In btrfs_qgroup_rescan_worker can't we make the check for
BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED be done _before_ starting the transaction by
refactoring the body of the loop? Even better will be to move the
FS_QUOTA_ENABLED check in rescan_should_stop. That way transaction
commit/quota disable will be delayed until the end of the current
qgroup_rescan_leaf invocation, no?
