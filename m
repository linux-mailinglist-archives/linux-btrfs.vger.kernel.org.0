This is my assumption as well. I believe that VM images was one of the 
original use cases (though I have no reference to that at the moment).

The btrfs wiki[1] says the following for autodefrag:

"Though autodefrag affects newly written data, it can read a few 
adjacent blocks (up to 64k) and write the contiguous extent to a new 
location. The adjacent blocks will be unshared."

The Btrfs administration manual[2] says the following:

"When enabled, small random writes into files (in a range of tens of 
kilobytes, currently itâ€™s 64KiB) are detected and queued up for the 
defragmentation process. Not well suited for large database workloads."

I have a worst-case scenario with Netdata. It stores historical data in 
ndf files that are up to 1GiB in size. In addition there is a journal 
file of about 100-200MiB. The extents are extremely small and sequential 
read speeds are around 1-2MiB/s (this is a HDD), which makes fetching 
historical data _extremely_ slow.

I have "mount -o autodefrag" enabled but it has no effect on these 
files. I have also tried enabling compression with "btrfs propterty set 
compression zstd" but it did not reduce the file size or change the 
amount of extents much.

As a last resort I tried running Netdata behind "eatmydata", but it also 
didn't help.

It seems that this case is exactly as Zygo describes, that small amounts 
of random writes do not get considered for defragment. It takes about 5 
days to fill one of these ndf datafiles (about 8-9MiB per hour).

Doesn't userspace defragment has the disadvantage that is has to process 
the whole file with all it's extents? But if it could be used to defrag 
only the last few modified extents could help in situations like this? 
Certainly a userspace defragment daemon could be used to implement 
custom policies suitable for specific workloads.
