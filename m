So think of it as splitting a block group into 64k chunks (those are the
stripes) then finding in which such 64k chunk/stripe_nr logical falls
within, so len would be the length of an io you could do without
crossing this 64k boundary. This process is described in
https://github.com/btrfs/btrfs-dev-docs/blob/master/bio-submission.txt
under section 'Bio mapping'. With this in mind I'd say it's  [logical,
logical+len] without crossing a 64k boundary. !!!HOWEVER!!!!  This
applies to bg types other than SINGLE , that's the
if (map->type & BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_PROFILE_MASK) check in the function.
We do this because for raid levels we'd like the io granularity to be
64k, whereas for SINGLE we simply issue a single write, i.e len is
calculated as:

len = em->len - offset;

which is why you are getting such the size of the block group.



>   1.2 @len is currently unused in btrfs_bio_clone_partial(), is this correct?

It's used to calculate @clone_len parameter so it's indirectly involved
in btrfs_bio_clone_partial.

See above.

The assert got added quite a while back so I'm not entirely sure it's
pertinent.

Can we though? So if size in btrfs_bio_clone_partial is switched to u64
then in that fuction we do size >> 9 potentially having a value of at
most 55 bits, passing it to bio_trim, which in turn takes an int. So
you'd be truncating values at the time you call bio_trim, no ?
