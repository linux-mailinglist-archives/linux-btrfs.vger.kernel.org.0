This can be simplified to if (btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, ENOSPC_DEBUG)) 
and nested inside the next if (left < bytes). I checked 
and even with the extra nesting the code doesn't break the 76 char limit.

This can be turned into a simple if (!IS_ERR(bg)) {}

The single btrfs_block_rsv_add call and the addition of bytes to chunk_bytes_reserved 
can be collapsed into the above branch. The end result looks like: https://pastebin.com/F09TjVWp

This is results in slightly shorter and more linear code => easy to read.

Better to use lockdep_assert_held.
