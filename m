Not yet.  It's actually read_merkle_tree_page(), not read_merkle_tree_block().
The callees want a page index, and pages always have size PAGE_SIZE.  So the
current function prototype is appropriate for the current design.

But you definitely need to think about what changes should be made to allow XFS
to do the Merkle tree caching the way the other XFS developers want it to do.
There will be significantly more to that than potentially changing a function
prototype.  There's been some discussion of this on the "fs-verity support for
XFS" thread, but there's not a detailed proposal yet.

Note: you should store Merkle tree blocks in the xattrs instead of "pages", so
that the on-disk format isn't tied to the page size.
