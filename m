If the lock class is defined statically, even for dynamically initialized
locks, then its associated object sits either in the core kernel or within
a module.

So if it's in the core kernel, it could be added to the hash table at kernel
init and stay there forever.

If it's in a module, it would be added to the hash table on module load and
removed on module unload. We would have to be careful about how the ftrace
printout to human readable text deals with missing hash table data, because
that printout will happen after buffering, so an untimely module unload could
make this address to string mapping unavailable for a few events. If we care
about getting this corner case right there are a few things we could do as
well.

Thanks,

Mathieu
