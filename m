I've spent the last day getting a grasp on everything that we want and I'm in a
better place to answer these questions.

There seemed to be some confusion around having nested subvolumes with different
keys, and then reflinking between them.

So 

/container
/container/subcontainer

reflink /container/packagefile /container/subcontainer/packagefile

in this case the inode context wouldn't help, the inodes are different, thus the
heavy weight design is necessary.

However this isn't actually a thing that is a topline need.  I've told our
customers that in this case both /container and /container/subcontainer would
need to share encryption keys, and so this eliminates the need for the heavier
weight solution.  I like your design better, I think it fits most of our goals.

The actual real requirement we have is the unencrypted to encrypted, which is

/base/image
btrfs sub snap /base/image /container
turn on encryptiong /container

new writes in /container get encrypted.  We also want to be able to do

reflink /path/to/unencrypted/package/store/package /container/package

and have this work.  This still works with your design.  The only thing we would
reject with our design is

reflink /encrypted/key1/file /encrypted/key2/file

because the key id's wouldn't match.  This is an acceptable limitation for us to
acheive a more simplistic design.

Since the scope is purely unencrypted snapshot -> encrypted this is much
simpler, only new things get the encryption policy set.

Say we snapshot, set the encryption key, and then write to the middle of a file.
That inode gets its encryption policy set, and that file extent is marked as
encrypted.  When we go to read back that whole file later we see the unencrypted
extents and read those like normal, then get to the encrypted extent and decrypt
that like normal.

That's fair.  Like I said I've purposefully stayed out of this part because it's
quite a bit to page in a whole other project into my head and figure out what
would be the best course of action.  I think that narrowing our usecase to only
wanting to support unencrypted->encrypted for snapshots will make this simpler,
and integrating your more simplified light weight design for extent encryption
will result in something more to your liking.  Thanks,

Josef
