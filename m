Please send a separate patch for that.

This could be usefor for some cases but I think not for the protocol,
the version is linear and we want to batch the changes into one
version. Othewise it creates dependency and configuration
complications, and users don't always listen to the "this is still
experimental" should it be meant to be outside of the debug build.
