Thanks, so it's roughly 8K per 1M.

No big deal, such things can slip in. I would not point them out unless
there's another reason to resend the patches. Once all the real things
are done I do a pass just fixing style.

Yeah, there are already some key descriptions, so that should be the
palce where to look. You can of course repeat what yout need in this
comment for context and so that the text is understandable without going
to other files.

Forcing the type by assigning it to another variable is ok. The problem
is potential multiple evaluation of inode->i_size. Here's a real example
how this can lead to real bugs
https://git.kernel.org/linus/d98da49977f67394db492 , in that case it was
inside max(). Reading that again, just using i_size_read is not
sufficient because it still does not have READ_ONCE. We had to emulate
it using compiler barrier.

But now I realize the i_size can't change because fsverity works in
read-only mode once enabled on the inode, right? In that case the only
concern would indeed be the type safety for round_up.

Yeah, according to commit c93d8f88580921c84d it seems to be the maximum
expected page size, in that case a symbolic name would be more
appropriate.

fs/ext4/verity.c:
* Using a 64K boundary rather than a 4K one keeps things ready for
* architectures with 64K pages, and it doesn't necessarily waste space on-disk

So the reason why you probably want to use loff_t is
inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes, which is loff_t. As this is a constant
MAX_LFS_FILESIZE (sb initialized in btrfs_fill_super), I think you can
replace all instances of sb->s_maxbytes by that, or add something like
BTRFS_MAX_INODE_SIZE that will be u64.

The VFS interface has to use loff_t but as we use u64 in btrfs for
almost everything I'd rather unify that according to the style used in
btrfs and make sure that the conversion is OK on the VFS->FS boundary.

The index gets cast to loff_t before shift, so that's what you'd have to
do here too.

Thanks.
