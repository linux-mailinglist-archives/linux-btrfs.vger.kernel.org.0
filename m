The whole case is described by this syzbot report:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/00000000000041d47405f9f56290@google.com/

Where we have balance and scrub hitting the problem.

The ASSERT() itself is going to be removed by the scrub rework, but if 
the old code can lead to that ASSERT(), the reworked code should still 
lead to the same situation, as the scrub/balance exclusion code is still 
kept as is.

And in that dmesg, we got quite some tree block bytenr mismatch, which 
indicates the tree block is already zeroed out.

The syzbot report is before my scrub rework, and the scrub pause code is 
untouched during the rework.

Although I did see your point, a deeper look into the existing scrub 
pause code indeed shows transaction commit would pause scrub before 
switch commit roots.

Allow me to dig deeper to find out why this syzbot can happen.

Thanks,
