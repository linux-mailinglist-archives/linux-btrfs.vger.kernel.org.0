I'm aware of the patch, changes like that need more than just three
reviews. Switching to sectorsize different than page size affects
kernels/arches that are configured like that, which is now namely arm64
but power8/9 is still around and I've checked only a few main distros.

The testing coverage of the subpage code is very low on arm64 due to
slow hardware some of us have and upstream support of the boards is
lagging behind. First we need enough testing coverage for functionality
and then at least some basic performance results. Anand sent some
benchmarks which is good, but still not sufficient.

The situation with hardware may change soon so this is a start of the
evaluation.

Changing defaults can take time and I can't promise any specific version
for that. We had a change in 5.15, it's better to pack more changes in
defaults to limit number of configuration so if there's next round the
4K will be among considered options. Until then we need to raise the
confidence that this will not cause problems.

There's a tracking issue for that with the points above
https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/issues/604 .

What we can do now is to add a warning or reminder that on a host with
64K pages the portability may be limited and that this should be
reconsidered, with examples where this applies etc.

And once the change to 4k is done, backward compatibility would be
possibly kept by adding 'page' as a special keyword for sectorsize.
