I have a question about how this will work from the point of view of the
sysadmin.

I have a number of different systems between which I need send and
receive working. Some are stable machines - many using distro stable
kernels. Some are new machines (most running debian testing but
occasionally with a newer kernel for some other reason). Some are
managed by other people and I don't control the kernel or progs versions
or am even told when they change.

I need to be able to generate a send stream on any system and receive it
on any other system. However, I don't want to be limited to just the
very oldest version of the protocol: for some tasks I am willing to take
into account the target system capabilities when generating a send
stream for that task.

So, I think what I need is:

1) A mechanism to query a receiving system to find out what protocol
range it supports for receive (taking into account *both* kernel and
btrfs-receive capabilities). And when I say "protocol version" I mean
feature level - the reported "version" must define not just encodings
but also what capabilities it can handle.

2) A mechanism to select what protocol version (in the sense above)
btrfs-send should use in the stream (again, kernel and user space).

3) **Preferably** filesystem features on the sending side which require
protocol features outside the selected range would be emulated using
features in the earlier protocols. If that cannot be done,
**definitely** abort the send and report an error. If the send completes
without error the stream must be within the specified protocol range and
work on a receiver which claims to support that range.

That way, I can check which version the receiver supports (maybe in a
script in real time or maybe as a config option I change when necessary)
and generate a send stream which it can use. And if I can't do that, I
get a clear error. I would also be able to request tools like btrbk to
use this information when taking snapshot backups.

I am not sure I can do that with the mechanisms being proposed here. Am
I missing something?

Graham
