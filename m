This gives me an impression that the helper in your view helps
readability and that's something I'm fine with. In the past we got
cleanups that remove one time helpers so I'm affected by that. Also the
helpers hide some details like the transaction start that could be
considered heavy so the helper kind of obscures that. But there's
another aspect, again readability, "do that and the caller does not need
to care", and when the helper is static in the same file it's easy to
look up and not a big deal.

I don't think it's dumb, the nlink check is one line with several lines
of comment explaining and also described in the changelog as a corner
case and it's not obvious. For that reason a helper is fine and let's
keep the helpers as they are, so it's consistent. It's just when I'm
reading the code I'm questioning everything but it does not mean that
all of that needs to be done the way I see it, in the comments I'm
just exploring the possibility to do so.
