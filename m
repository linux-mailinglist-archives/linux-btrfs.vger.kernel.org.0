Instead of having this code here, wouldn't it be better if it's moved in
priority_reclaim_metadata_space since this behavior is really part of
the flushing behavior, similarly to how maybe_fail_all_tickets is called
from the ordinary reclaim path? Actually reading the comment about
calling btrfs_try_granting_tickets makes me think that the !list_empty()
condition should also be moved in priority_reclaim_metadata_space as
those behaviors only pertain to priority tickets, since ordinary ticket
will either have been satisfied or failed due to maybe_fail_all_tickets
always removing ordinary tickets from the ticket list hence the
list_empty() will always be true for them.


If I have to be even more nit-picky the priority flushing path is
priority_reclaim_metadata_space and not handle_reserve_ticket itself. So
the code is slightly contradicting the last sentence in the changelog :)
