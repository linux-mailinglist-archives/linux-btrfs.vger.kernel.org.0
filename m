This is a very good point.

The current Wiki page for btrfs (linked above) says:

This is admittedly a very tough problem to solve.  Nevertheless, the concern
that I have with that recommendation above is that it gives copyright holders
whose notices are grandfathered an additional notice preservation that new
copyright holders don't have equal access to.  It's particular problematic
because new contributors are unable to have contributions included unless
they remove copyright notices.

Again, I realize the trade-offs are really tough here; removing existing
copyright notices without explicit permission is a *serious* problem (both a
GPL violation and a statutory violation of copyright generally in many
jurisdictions).  OTOH, a list of every last copyright holder is painfully
unwieldy — even if you combine it into a single location.

Most importantly, I want to point out the bigger, implicit trade-off here
that some may not realize.  If you relying on Git history to have copyright
notice information, it does make the entire Git repository a required part of
the complete, corresponding source under GPLv2.  This will become even more
certain when contributors are being told that they may *not* include a
copyright notice and that their copyright information will appear in metadata
instead.  They can reasonably interpret the “appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice” in GPLv2§1 to mean the copyright
notices in the Git metadata.

All of that seems accurate to me.  What part is not accurate?

Splitting the information to talk about copyright and license separately
seems a good idea, but removing accurate explanations doesn't seem like a
good idea to me …
