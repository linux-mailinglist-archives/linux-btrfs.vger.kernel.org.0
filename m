IIRC the synology kernel sources are available as some .tar or .rpm
file, I don't know if there are the separate patches available anywhere.
Also it's up to synology ty upstream the patches. We've got some btrfs
patches from them that were good, but adding the MD API itself seems to
be an extensive change and harder to get accepted upstream. I haven't
seen the code so I can't say how much it would be intrusive to the btrfs
code but with enough cleanups and abstractions everything is possible.
