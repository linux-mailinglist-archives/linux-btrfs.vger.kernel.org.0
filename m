Overall this is a low-risk series and generally looks LGTM. I have a
couple of points which apply too all patches and I'm gonna list them here:

1. This is minor but might be a bit more informative - instead of
returning -EINVAL when an operation which is forbidden returning
-EOPNOTSUPP is closer to what is actually meant. ANd not that something
is invalid per-se. This is a minor point given for now this is purely a
developer feature.

2. The extent tree would be in development for quite some time, perhaps
at least 3-4 release if not more, during that time the code will be
sprinkled with the checks for the forbidden ops and even everyone will
be paying the (arguably small cost) of having them in the code. My point
is can't those compatibility checks be also gated behind
CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG? Eventually they will be removed but until this time
comes we'll have them in the respective call paths.
