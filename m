I've been thinking about this patch set a bit since it was posted, and
I've got some thoughts specifically about this.

A use-case that is extremely important to me is enabling background
encryption of parts or the whole filesystem, but also enabling
rekeying the encrypted data too. This can be necessary for a variety
of reasons. This is supported in LUKS/dm-crypt and I would like to
have this supported in Btrfs native encryption through fscrypt.

My understanding of this (after following all the discussions and
patch sets) is that heavyweight extents make this a fundamentally
cheaper and safer operation because there's no need to traverse
through the inodes and change them. This would be fairly expensive
and create a situation where inode sharing becomes much more limited
as rekeying occurs on active data while not occurring on old
snapshots, for example.

It's certainly a trade-off that leads to more complexity, but I think
it's worth it because key properties that people rely on with Btrfs
can be preserved even with encrypted data.
