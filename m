Sure, totally agree :)

Thanks for finding that, yes, we can do a cleanup later, if you have
a failed testing list welcome to provide to be references :)

Yes, xfs reflink can't work with DAX now, I don't know if it *will*, maybe
Darrick knows more details.

Hmm... good point, does it make sense to you, Darrick?

This patch can do what we talked in last patch, and welcome later patches from
extN forks:) I can help to deal with XFS part later. I don't know if btrfs has
similar troubles, welcome patches if they need too.

The change on _scratch_mkfs_blocksized will help common part, but can' help all
situations. Maybe better to let each fs change and test their fundamental helper
changes separately, to avoid regression :)

Thanks,
Zorro
