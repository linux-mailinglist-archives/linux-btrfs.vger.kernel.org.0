Which commit is this paragraph referring to? It will be helpful to
include a reference so once can actually trace the  history of this code.

AFAICS in the code and based on your problem statement it would seem the
culprit here is really the fact we are calling the 2nd sync_inode with
WBC_SYNC_NONE, which is an indicator for sync_inode (respectively.
writeback_single_inode) to simply return in case I_SYNC is still set
from the first invocation of sync_inode or if the inode doesn't have
I_DIRTY_ALL set. So wouldn't a simple fix be to change the wbc's
.sync_mode to the second sync_inode to be WB_SYNC_ALL that will ensure
that the 2nd sync_inode takes effect?

I think the last sentence can be omitted, simply prefix the paragraph
with N.B. or put a more generic warning e.g. "Be extra careful and
thoughtful when considering changing this logic".

nit: What's funny is that without this patch async_submit_wait actually
doesn't have a single user, it's only woken up in async_cow_submit but
nobody actually waited for it. Ideally it should have been removed when
its last user was removed. ;)
