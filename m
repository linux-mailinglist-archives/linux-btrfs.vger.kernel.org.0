It seems it's really just the Merkle tree caching interface that is causing
problems, as it's currently too closely tied to the page cache?  That is just an
implementation detail that could be reworked along the lines of what is being
discussed.

But anyway, it is up to the XFS folks.  Keep in mind there is also the option of
doing what btrfs is doing, where it stores the Merkle tree separately from the
file data stream, but caches it past i_size in the page cache at runtime.

I guess there is also the issue of encryption, which hasn't come up yet since
we're talking about fsverity support only.  The Merkle tree (including the
fsverity_descriptor) is supposed to be encrypted, just like the file contents
are.  Having it be stored after the file contents accomplishes that easily...
Of course, it doesn't have to be that way; a separate key could be derived, or
the Merkle tree blocks could be encrypted with the file contents key using
indices past i_size, without them physically being stored in the data stream.
