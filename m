I agree that this has risks of inadvertent misuse in that fashion.

The usecase I'm oriented towards is: someone builds an unencrypted 
subvolume with a container base filesystem, takes several snapshots of 
the subvolume, starts a container on each subvolume, and has each 
container encrypt its designated subvolume going forward with a 
different key. This usecase needs some way to mark a subvolume/directory 
already containing files as encrypted going forward; I've had a hard 
time coming up with a way to both protect users against such accidental 
misuse, but also allow this container usecase.

Could it be sufficient to check either empty or read-only, something 
like (is_empty_dir(inode) || (FS_CFLG_PARTIAL && !inode_permission(..., 
inode, MAY_WRITE)))? Then the user is unable to accidentally write 
unencrypted data, since they've taken an action to make the directory 
read-only, until they've set a policy and key and turned the directory 
read-write again.

Thanks!
