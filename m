Can you please make this comment properly describe the purpose of this test?
As-is it doesn't mention that it is related to fs-verity at all, let alone to
specific filesystems' implementations of fs-verity.

What is meant by the "fsverity MAX_DEPTH" check?

Using the "truncate" xfs_io command instead of "pwrite" would probably make more
sense here, as the goal is to just create a file of a specific size.

This calculation isn't completely accurate because it doesn't round the levels
to a block boundary.  Nor does it consider that the 64K is an alignment rather
than a fixed amount added.

But for the test you don't need the absolute largest file whose level 1 doesn't
exceed the limit, but rather just one almost that large.

So it would be okay to add 64K as a fixed amount, along with 4K for every level
on top of the 'sz/128^(level+1)' you already have, to get an over-estimate of
the amount of extra space needed to cache the Merkle tree.

But please make it clear that it's an over-estimate, and hence an under-estimate
of the file size desired for the test.

Also please document that this is all assuming SHA-256 with 4K blocks, and also
that the maximum file size is assumed to fit in 64 bits; hence the consideration
of 8 levels is sufficient.
