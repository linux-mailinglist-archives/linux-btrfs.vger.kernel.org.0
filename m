Oh yes we did. And this is a merry-go-round.

It is very much fine for a filesystems to support file handles without
wanting to support exporting via NFS. That is especially true for
in-kernel pseudo filesystems.

As I've said before multiple times I want a way to allow filesystems
such as pidfs and nsfs to use file handles without supporting export.
Whatever that fscking flag is called at this point I fundamentally don't
care. And we are reliving the same arguments over and over.

I will _hard NAK_ anything that starts mandating that export of
filesystems must be allowed simply because their file handles fit export
criteria. I do not care whether pidfs or nsfs file handles fit the bill.
They will not be exported.
