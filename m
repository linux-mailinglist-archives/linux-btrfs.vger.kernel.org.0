Thank you for the extremely useful information. I have not been 
following the policy, and also, probably was also carrying an 
assumption that messages are only accepted from subscribers, as I think 
is the policy on some lists, perhaps to control spam and trolling.

At any rate, perhaps some subscribers have the preference for not 
receiving patches, and might appreciate my idea, but I will be happy 
simply to use the list following in the way you suggest.
