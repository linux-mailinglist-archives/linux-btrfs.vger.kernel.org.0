Sorry, 2am changelogs aren't great.

In __write_extent_buffer() we do

offset = get_eb_offset_in_folio(eb, start);

start is the logical offset into the eb we're copying to, in this case it's 0
because we're doing copy_extent_buffer_full().  get_eb_offset_in_folio() does
this

        return offset_in_folio(eb->folios[0], offset + eb->start);

and offset_in_folio() does this

        return start & (eb->folio_size - 1);

so in this case offset is 0, so we're just passing in eb->start.

With subpage ->start can be not folio_size aligned, so this would be some
arbitrary offset into the folio.

The other places aren't a problem because we don't change eb->start after we
do the copy.  This is a problem because we're re-using a cloned eb, so we do
this

// start is 4k on a 16k pagesize fs, so we're at the 4k offset into the folio
copy_extent_buffer_full();

// now start is at 8k offset into the folio
cloned->start = 8k;

Any subsequent reads from the eb, by which I mean things like
btrfs_item_key_to_cpu(), anything we read the members out of the leaf are going
to use the same get_eb_offset_in_folio() helper and now come up with a different
answer than where we copied into.

All other places are fine, because we don't change ->start after we've copied
data into it.  I'll update the changelog to include this information, thanks,

Josef
