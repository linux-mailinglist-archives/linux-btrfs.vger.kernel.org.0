Yes, a directory for a filesystem with this flag could have both 
encrypted and unencrypted filenames.

When a directory switches to encrypted, the filesystem can get and store 
a fscrypt_context for it, as though it were a new directory. All new 
filenames for that directory will be encrypted, as will any filename 
lookup requests, by fscrypt_prepare_filename() since the directory has a 
context.

When a request for a lookup of a name in that directory comes in, it'll 
be an encrypted or nokey name; the directory can be searched for both 
the encrypted and unencrypted versions of that name. I don't think any 
filename collisions can result, as any encrypted filename which happens 
to match a plaintext filename will be detected as a collision when it's 
first added.

Good point.

Thanks!
