The in memory reduction is plausible. For extents that are in memory but 
not yet written to disk, we need some way to keep track of the context, 
but we could drop the nonce/policy after that. I was aiming to have the 
same structure so that there's maximal similarity in info creation and 
things like fscrypt_generate_iv would always be getting an info, 
regardless of inode vs extent, but we could throw a conditional in there 
and create a different structure for in-memory extent infos.

However, it seems like an extent and a leaf inode in inode fscrypt need 
the same information, so if splitting the fscrypt_info structure makes 
sense, maybe it should be on that boundary?

I might be misunderstanding what you're referencing, but I think you're 
talking about the change where with extent fscrypt, IO has to be forced 
down before removing a key, otherwise it is lost. I think that's a 
fundamental problem given the filesystem has no way to know that there 
are new, dirty pages in the pagecache until those pages are issued for 
write, so it can't create a new extent or few until that point, 
potentially after the relevant key has been evicted. But maybe I'm 
missing a hook that would let us make extents earlier.

I suppose we could give each leaf inode a proper nonce/prepared key 
instead of borrowing its parent dir's: if a write came in after the key 
was removed but the inode is still open, the new extent(s) could grab 
the key material out of the inode's info. I don't like this very much 
since it could result in multiple extents grabbing the same key 
material, but I suppose it could work if it's important to maintain that 
behavior.

Being able to rekey a directory is the reason for having full contexts: 
suppose I take a snapshot of an encrypted dir and want to change the key 
for new data going forward, to avoid using a single key on too much 
data. It's too expensive to reencrypt every extent with the new key, 
since the whole point of a snapshot is to make a lightweight copy that 
gets COWed on write. Then each extent needs to know what its own master 
key identifier/policy/flags are, since different extents in the same 
file could have different master keys. We could say the mode and flags 
have to match, but it doesn't seem to me worth saving seven bytes to add 
a new structure to just store the master key identifier and nonce.

For a non-Meta usecase, from what I've heard from Fedora-land, it's 
possibly interesting to them to be able to ship an encrypted image, and 
then be able to change the key after encrypted install to something 
user-controlled.

Without rekeying, my understanding is that we may write too much data 
with one key for safety; notes in the updated design doc 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1janjxewlewtVPqctkWOjSa7OhCgB8Gdx7iDaCDQQNZA/edit?usp=sharing 
are that writing more than 1P per key raises cryptographic concerns, and 
since btrfs is COW and could have volumes up to the full 16E size that 
btrfs supports, we don't want to have just one immutable key per subvol.

To me the lightweight-on-disk vision sounds a lot like the original 
design: 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/YXGyq+buM79A1S0L@relinquished.localdomain 
and the Nov '22 version of the patchset: 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/cover.1667389115.git.sweettea-kernel@dorminy.me/ 
(which didn't have rekeying). I think rekeying is worth the higher disk 
usage; but I'm probably missing something about how your vision differs 
from the original. Could you please take a look at it again?

As above, not necessarily

A good point, and if you want me to take advantage of the 
one-copy-per-inode fact for general extent-based fscrypt I can do so.

Many thanks!
