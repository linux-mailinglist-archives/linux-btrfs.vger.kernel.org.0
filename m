Hi,

sorry I did not notice you replied some time ago.

The compatibility problems are there for any new feature and usually
it's strict no mount, while here we can do a read-only compat mode at
least. Deploying a new feature should always take the fallback mount
into account, so it's advisable to wait a few releases eg. up to the
next stable release.

Luckily in that case we can backport the compatibility to the older
stable trees so the fallback would work after a minor release.

So I hope this would get covered by the backports, as discussed, to 5.4
and 5.10.

My motivation is not aesthetic, rather I'm very conservative when
on-disk structures get changed, and inode is the core structure.
Curiously, you can thank Josef who switched the per-inode compat flags
to whole-filesystem only in f2b636e80d8206dd40 "Btrfs: add support for
compat flags to btrfs". But that was in 2008 and was a hard incompatible
change that lead to the last major format change (the _BHRfS_M
signature).

If the incompat change can be squeezed into existing structure, it
leaves the reserved fileds untouched. Right now we have 4x u64. Any
other change requires increasing the item size which is ultimately
possible but brings other problems. So if there's a possibily not to go
to the next level, I'll pursue it. Right now the major objection is the
problem with deployment and fallback mount, but I think this is solved.

Until now I haven't found any problem with the ro compat flags merged to
normal flags on itself, so as agreed offline, we're going to do that.
