If you don't do the sync, you don't get even mdadm's weak corruption
detection--it will present an overwhelming number of false positives.

Of course mdadm can only tell you the two devices are different--it
can't tell you which one (if any) is correct.

This tells me everything I need to know about mdadm. It can only save my data in case both drive originally had correct data, and one of the drives completely disappears. A mdadm raid-1 (mirror) array ironically increases the likelihood of data corruption. If one drive has a 1% change of corrupting the data, 2 of those drives in mdadm raid 1 have a 2% chance of corrupting the data, and 100 of these drives in raid 1 will 100% corrupt the data. (This is a bit of an oversimplification, and statistically not entirely sound, but it gets my point across). For me this defeats the purpose of a raid system, as raid should increase the redundancy and resilience. 

Would it be possible to add a checksum to the data in mdadm in much the same way btrfs is doing that, so it can also detect and even repair corruption on the block level?

Strictly correct, but somewhere between unhelpful and misleading.

The motivation behind the question is clearly to compare mdadm and btrfs

capabilities wrt recovery from data poisoning.  He presented an example
of an experiment performed on btrfs demonstrating that capability.

He neglected to ask separate questions about poisoning both individual
drives, but you also neglected to point this omission out.

I was trying to figure out if my data could survive if one of the drives (partially)failed. I only know of two ways to simulate this: physically disconnecting the drive, or dd-ing random data to it. I didn't state it in my original question, but I wanted to first poison one drive, then scrub the data, and then poison the next drive, and scrub again, until all drives has been poisoned and scrubbed. I have tested this with 2 set's of a backing drive and a writeback  SSD cache. No matter which drive was poisoned, all the data survived although reconstructing the data was about 30x slower than reading correct data.

What else can happen is that btrfs raid1 reconstructs the data on a
damaged device from the other non-damaged device, regardless of which
device is damaged.  btrfs can verify the contents of each device and
identify which copy (if any) is correct.  mdadm cannot.

Yes, but only if btrfs has direct access to each drive separately. mdadm is hiding the individual drives from btrfs.

> Thanks god you told us, because we are all so much stupid!
I am stupid, or at least not so deeply informed. I have only worked with multi-drive configurations for a few weeks now.

Well, the rule of thumb is "never use mdadm for any use case where
you can
use btrfs instead,"

My rule of thumb is "never run adadm". I don't see a use case where it increases the longevity of my data. 

 and answering yet another mdadm-vs-btrfs FAQ normally

wouldn't be interesting; however, this setup used mdadm --write-mostly
which is relatively unusual around here (and makes the posting appear
under a different set of search terms), so I wrote a short reply to
Cedric's question as it was not a question I had seen answered before.

Hours later, you presented an alternative analysis that contained the
results of an experiment that demonstrated mdadm success under specific
conditions arising from a very literal interpretation of the question.
I had to reread the mdadm kernel sources to remind myself how it could
work, because it's a corner case outcome that I've never observed or
even heard third-party reports of for mdadm in the wild.  That was a
fun puzzle to solve, so I wanted to write about it.

Your setup has significant data loss risks that you did not mention.
A user who was not very familiar with both btrfs and mdadm, but who
stumbled across this thread during a search of the archives, might not
understand the limited scope of your experimental setup and why it did
not detect or cause any of the expected data loss failures.  This user
might, upon reading your posting, incorrectly conclude that this setup
is a viable way to store data with btrfs self-repair capabilities intact.

I was looking for a way to give a the drives of a btrfs filesystem a write cache, in such a way that a failure of a single drive could not result in data loss. As bcache does not and will not support multiple redundant ssd's as write cache [1], my plan was to put 2 identical ssd's in mdadm raid 1, as host for a bcache writecack cache for all the drives of the btrfs filesytem. See the figure below:
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|          btrfs raid 1 (2 copies) /mnt                     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| /dev/bcache0 | /dev/bcache1 | /dev/bcache2 | /dev/bcache3 |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| Mdadm Raid 1 mirrored Writeback Cache (SSD)               |
| /dev/md/name (cointaining /dev/sda3 and /dev/sda4)        |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| Data         | Data         | Data         | Data         |
| /dev/sda8    | /dev/sda9    | /dev/sda10   | /dev/sda11   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
This will not protect my data if one of the SSD's starts to return random data, as mdadm can't see who of the two SSD's is correct. This will also defeat the redundancy of btrfs, as all copies of the data that btrfs sees are coming from the ssd pair.
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bcache/e03dd593-14cb-b4a0-d68a-bd9b4fb8bd20@suse.de/T/#t

The only way I've come up with is to give each hard drive in the btrfs array it's own writeback bcache, but that requires double the amount of drives.


Those were significant omissions, a second reason to write about them.

Initially I thought you accidentally omitted these details due to
inexperience or inattention, but as you say, you know mdadm.  If that's
true, your omissions were intentional.  That information is also
potentially not obvious for someone reading this thread in the archives,

so I am writing about it too.

No.  That was the point.  btrfs cannot fix mdadm if mdadm trashes both
copies of the data underneath.  The btrfs self-repair features only work

when btrfs has access to both mirror copies.  On top of mdadm, btrfs
can only help you identify the data you have already lost.  btrfs is
especially picky about its metadata--if even one bit of metadata is
unrecoverably lost, the filesystem can only be repaired by brute force
means (btrfs check --repair --init-extent-tree, or mkfs and start over).


This branch of the thread is a little over-focused on the bitrot case.
The somewhat more significant problem with this setup is that write
ordering rules are violated on sdb during resync with sda.  During resync

there may be no complete and intact copy of btrfs metadata on sdb, so
if sda fails at that time, the filesystem may be severely damaged or
unrecoverable, even if there is no bitrot at all.  Depending on write
workloads and disk speeds, the window of vulnerability may last for
minutes to hours.

That's a pretty common failure mode--a lot of drives don't die all
at once, especially at the low end of the market.  Instead, they have
reliability problems--the kind that will force a reboot and mdadm resync,

but not kick the device out of the array--just before they completely die.


If you are using mobile or desktop drives, the second most common 5-year

outcome from this setup will be filesystem loss.  The most common outcome

is that you don't have a disk failure on sda, so you don't need the second

disk at all.  Failures that mdadm can recover from are 3rd most likely,
followed by failures neither mdadm nor btrfs can recover from.

If you are using NAS or enterprise drives (and they're not relabled
desktop drives inside), then they are unlikely to throw anything at mdadm

that mdadm cannot handle; however, even the best drives break sometimes,

I am misusing consumer drives in my NAS. Most of the hard drives and SSD's have been given to me, and are medium old to very old. That's why I am trying to build a system that can survive a single drive failure. That's also the reason why I build 2 NAS boxes, my primary NAS syncs to my slave nas once per day).

and this puts you in one of the other probability scenarios.

If you are using cheap SSDs then the probabilities flip because they
do not report errors that mdadm can detect, and they tend to trigger
more mdadm resyncs on average due to firmware issues and general
low reliability.  Partial data loss (that would have been recoverable
with btrfs raid1) is the most likely outcome, unrecoverable filesystem
failure is 2nd.  Keeping your data for 5 years moves down to the 3rd
most likely outcome.

Silent data corruption seems to be far more common on SSDs than HDDs, so

the risk of unrecoverable corruption is highest when mdadm --write-mostly

is used with the HDD as component disk #1 and the SSD as disk #0.

btrfs raid1 recovers from all of these cases except 2-drive same-sector
failures and host RAM failure.

Also, your stated use case is slightly different from Cedic's:

> You can use mdadm to do this (I'm using this feature since years in

> setup where I have to fallback on USB disks for any reason).

Here, you are mirroring up a relatively reliable disk onto one or more
removable USB devices.  Depending on the details, this setup can have
a different failure profile than the SSD/HDD use case.  If you rotate
multiple USB devices so that you always have one offline intact mirror of

the filesystem, then if there is a failure during resync and the online
USB disk has a destroyed filesystem, the offline disk will still be
intact and you can still use it to recover, but it will have older data.

In the SSD/HDD use case, there is only one mirror pair, so there is no
isolated copy that could survive a failure during resync.

The corruption propagation between drives is different too--if you can
run a btrfs scrub, and detect corruption on the primary drive in time,
you can retrieve the missing data from the offline mirror.  With only
two online drives, it's a challenge to access the intact mirror (you
have to ensure mdadm never resyncs, and use btrfs restore directly on
the mirror device).

It is a real use case for other people.  Disks do silently corrupt data
(especially low end SSDs), so it's reasonable to expect a modern raid1
implementation to be able to recover from damage to either drive, and
reasonable to test that capability by intentionally wiping one of them.

Thanks for confirming sometimes drives do silently corrupt data. I have not yet seen this happen "in the wild".

Just remember to test wiping the other one too.

Of course, always test all failure modes for all drives, and document the recovery procedures. After testing, fill the system with real data, and do everything in your power to prevent drives failing.

Then it's time to restore the backups. This may also be the moment to replace the drives, as the cosmic rays could have degraded the electronics.

Thanks everybody in this thread for taking the time to tell me about the inner workings of btrfs and mdadm. This has saved me a lot of time.
