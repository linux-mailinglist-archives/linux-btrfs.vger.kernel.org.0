Yes, thank you for posting another batch of arguments that support the  
use of my vision of defrag instead of the current one.

The defrag that I'm proposing will preserve all those reflinks that  
were painstakingly created by the user. Therefore, I take that you  
agree with me on the utmost importance of implementing this new defrag  
that I'm proposing.

There, I don't even need to write a solution. You are getting better.

I suggest that btrfs should first try to determine whether it can  
split an extent in-place, or not. If it can't do that, then it should  
create new extents to split the old one.

Yes, you have to determine which blocks are unused, and to do that you  
have to analyze all the b-trees. Only the defrag can do this. And, it  
should do this.

Notice that doing this garbage collection gets much easier when the  
defrag has created, in-memory, the two arrays I described in another  
part of this discussion, namely:
  - "extent-backref" associative array
  - "region-extents" plain array

Since defrag is supposed to have this two arrays always in memory and  
always valid and in-sync, doing this "garbage collection" becomes  
quite easy, even trivial.

Therefore, the defrag can free unused parts of any extent, and then  
the extent can be split is necessary. In fact, both these operations  
can be done simultaneously.

This is sovled simply by always running defrag before dedupe.

"the defrag cost is directly proportional to size" - this is wrong.  
The defrag cost is proportional to file size, not to extent size.

Before a file is defragmented, the defrag should split its extents so  
that each one is sufficiently small, let's say 32 MB at most. That  
fixes the issue. This was mentioned in my answer to Austin S.  
Hemmelgarn.

Then, as the final stage of the defrag, the extents should be merged  
into bigger ones of desired size.

This is a tiny detail not worthy of consideration at this stage of  
planning. It can be solved.

You don't know that because you can't predict the future. Therefore,  
defrag is never a waste because the future is unknown.

Actually, many of the problems that you wrote about so far in this  
thread are not problems in my imagined implementation of defrag, which  
can solves them all. The problems you wrote about are mostly problems  
of this implementation/library of yours.

So yes, you can do things that way as in your library, but that is  
inferior to real defrag.

Great, so there already exists an implementation, or at least a similar one.

Now, that split and merge just have to be moved into kernel.
  - I would keep merge and split as separate operations.
  - If a split cannot be performed due to problems you mention, then  
it should just return and do nothing. Same with merge.

Eventually, when a real defrag starts to be written, those two (split  
and merge) can be updated to make use of "extent-backref" associative  
array and "region-extents" plain array, so that they can be performed  
more efficiently and so that they always succeed.

Obviously, some very usefull code. That is good, but perhaps it would  
be better for that code to serve as an example of how it can be done.
In my imagined defrag, this updating-of-references happens as part of  
flushing the "pending operations buffer", so it will have to be  
rewritten such that it fits into that framework.

The problem of your defrag is that it is not holistic enough. It has a  
view of only small parts of the filesystem, so it can never be as good  
as a real defrag, which also doesn't unshare extents.

Another person said that it is complicated to trace backreferences. So  
now you are saying that it is not.
Anyway, such a structure must be available to defrag.
So, just in case to avoid misunderstandings, this "extent-backrefs"  
associative array would be in-memory, it would cover all extents, the  
entire filesystem structure, and it would be kept in-sync with the  
filesystem during the defrag operation.

Ok, thanks, finally someone agrees with me, at least 70%. I feel like  
I'm on the shooting range here carrying a target on my back and  
running around.

I disagree. I might explain my thoughts in aother place (this post is  
getting too long).

Yes. But, any defrag which is based on unsharing will fail in such a  
situation, in one way or another. The arguments for current defrag  
always mention the ways in which it won't fail, forgetting to mention  
that it will ALWAYS fail in at least one, sometimes disastrous way.  
But always a different one. Really, it is an inhonest debate.
