Thanks for sending this out!

It's going to take me a while to go through everything, so please bear with me.
In general I'd also really like to be seeing more feedback from the other btrfs
developers.  This is a hard project that really needs more eyes on it.

From a brief look through your patchsets, there's one thing I want to bring up
right away.  It seems that one important design choice that you've made that has
impacted much of your patchsets is that you've made each extent a fully
standalone thing, similar to inodes currently.  I.e.,

    (a) Each extent gets a full 'fscrypt_context' stored along with it.  That
        includes not just the nonce, but also the encryption modes and master
        key identifier.

    (b) For runtime caching, each extent gets a full 'struct fscrypt_info'
        object.  It doesn't "belong" to any inode; it's set up in a fully
        standalone way, and the master key lookup and removal logic operates
        directly on the extent's 'struct fscrypt_info'.

I'm not sure this is a good idea.  What I had thought it was going to look like
is that the encryption context/policy and 'struct fscrypt_info' would stay a
property of the inode, and the extents themselves would be much more lightweight
-- both on disk and in the cache.  On-disk, all that should really be needed for
an extent is the nonce for deriving the per-extent key.  And in-memory, all that
should really be needed is a "fscrypt_prepared_key" for the per-extent key, and
a reference to the owning inode.

I think that would avoid many of the problems that it seems you've had to work
around or have had to change user-visible semantics for.  For example the
problems involving master keys being added and removed.  It would also avoid
having to overload 'fscrypt_info' to be either a per-inode or a per-extent key.
And it would save space on disk and in memory.

Can you elaborate on why you went with a more "heavyweight" extents design?

Maybe your motivation is that extents can be referenced by more than one inode
and thus do not have a unique owning inode?  That's true, but I don't think that
really matters.  All the inodes that reference an extent will have the same
encryption policy, right?  Also, it looks like the "struct extent_map" that
you're caching the per-extent key in is already cached on a per-inode basis, in
btrfs_inode::extent_tree, similar to the pagecache which is also per-inode.  So
if the same extent happens to be accessed via multiple inodes, that's still
going to cause the fscrypt key to be set up twice anyway.
