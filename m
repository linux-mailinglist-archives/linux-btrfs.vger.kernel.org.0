Hi Roman,


thanks for you ideas. Unfortunately none is valid here. I have for sure 
no snapshots and I have mounted the device with compression enabled:

root@backuppc42:~# btrfs subvolume list /var/lib/backuppc
root@backuppc42:~# mount| grep backup
/dev/mapper/crypt_drbd2 on /var/lib/backuppc type btrfs 
(rw,noatime,compress=zstd:3,space_cache,subvolid=5,subvol=/)

I do not like the idea of going to full file sync for my rsync backups 
as the bandwidth is my concern here. And it does not help either as I 
have compression enabled, right?

Any further ideas?

Greetings
/CV
