Honestly Neal, I don't know how I should interpret your Reviewed-by. You
don't contribute code or otherwise comment on other patches on the
technical level. If you as an involved user want to give feedback that
some feature is desired then it's fine to do so but the rev-by tag is
not the way to do that.
