I think maybe we make that bit a separate patch, and leave the panic fix on it's 
own.  I suggested this because I have lofty ideas of killing the refs_lock, and 
this would at least keep us consistent in our usage TREE_REF to save us from 
freeing stuff that may be currently under IO.

I'm super not happy with our reference handling coupled with releasepage, but 
these are the kind of hoops we're going to have to jump through until we have 
some better infrastructure in place to handle metadata.  Thanks,

Josef
