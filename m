Tracepoints already solved that problem.

Look at the macro DEFINE_TRACE_FN() in include/linux/tracepoint.h. You will notice that
it statically defines a struct tracepoint in a separate section and a tracepoint_ptr_t
in a __tracepoints_ptrs section.

Then the other parts of the picture are in kernel/tracepoint.c:

extern tracepoint_ptr_t __start___tracepoints_ptrs[];
extern tracepoint_ptr_t __stop___tracepoints_ptrs[];

and kernel/module.c:find_module_sections()

#ifdef CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS
        mod->tracepoints_ptrs = section_objs(info, "__tracepoints_ptrs",
                                             sizeof(*mod->tracepoints_ptrs),
                                             &mod->num_tracepoints);
#endif

and the iteration code over kernel and modules in kernel/tracepoint.c.

All you need in addition is in include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h, we add
to the DATA_DATA define an entry such as:

        STRUCT_ALIGN();                                                 \
        *(__tracepoints)                                                \

and in RO_DATA:

                . = ALIGN(8);                                           \
                __start___tracepoints_ptrs = .;                         \
                KEEP(*(__tracepoints_ptrs)) /* Tracepoints: pointer array */ \
                __stop___tracepoints_ptrs = .; 

AFAIU, if you do something similar for a structure that contains your relevant
lock information, it should be straightforward to handle statically initialized
locks.
