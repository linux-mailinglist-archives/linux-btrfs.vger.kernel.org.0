I didn't give a RB because the patch is too small in the sense that it
shows just a single caller. In order to be able to better ascertain how
useful is I was expecting you'd submit a larger series containing all
the necessary changes. Additionally, does this patch relate to the
changes in 'btrfs: Use btrfs_find_item whenever possible' or are those 2
independent?
