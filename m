If you're forcing the filesystem to read-only anyway, why not just rely on the
filesystem-wide ro_compat flag, which you already implemented and which already
does that?  What benefit does the per-file ro_compat flag have, if it doesn't
actually make just the file read-only (which would be the expected behavior)?
You might as well just use a "regular" inode flag in that case.
