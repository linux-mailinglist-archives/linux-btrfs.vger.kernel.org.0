There were quite a few snapshots that I deleted on that system. But 
those snapshots were probably heavily de-duplicated since I was using 
the beesd tool to deduplicate the filesystem while in use.
At the moment, I just want to copy off some data from that filesystem, 
since that server is going to be cancelled.

Could I just mount the FS readonly, would that prevent the btrfs-cleaner 
from running and eating all my ram?
