This is actually a kernel bug, so please don't work around it in the test :-(

It will be fixed by the kernel patch
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20210916203424.113376-1-ebiggers@kernel.org

It's hard to follow the above explanation.  I'm still wondering whether it could
be simplified a lot.  Maybe something like the following:

# The goal of this second test is to make a big enough file that we trip the
# EFBIG codepath, but not so big that we hit it immediately when writing the
# first Merkle leaf.
#
# The Merkle tree is stored with the leaf node level (L0) last, but it is
# written first.  To get an interesting overflow, we need the maximum file size
# (MAX) to be in the middle of L0 -- ideally near the beginning of L0 so that we
# don't have to write many blocks before getting an error.
# 
# With SHA-256 and 4K blocks, there are 128 hashes per block.  Thus, ignoring
# padding, L0 is 1/128 of the file size while the other levels in total are
# 1/128**2 + 1/128**3 + 1/128**4 + ... = 1/16256 of the file size.  So still
# ignoring padding, for L0 start exactly at MAX, the file size must be s such
# that s + s/16256 = MAX, i.e. s = MAX * (16256/16257).  Then to get a file size
# where MAX occurs *near* the start of L0 rather than *at* the start, we can
# just subtract an overestimate of the padding: 64K after the file contents,
# then 4K per level, where the consideration of 8 levels is sufficient.
sz=$(echo "scale=20; $max_sz * (16256/16257) - 65536 - 4096*8" | $BC -q | cut -d. -f1)


That gives a size only 4103 bytes different from your calculation, and IMO is
much easier to understand.
