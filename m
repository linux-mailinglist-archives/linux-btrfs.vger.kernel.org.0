I am not sure how a deduplication tool is compatible with multiple snapshot.
In theory both the snapshot and the deduplication create multiple reference to the same pieces of data.
However snapshot does the same for metadata (and this is good); instead dedup does the opposite: unshare the metadata to improve the sharing between the files of the same pieces of data (bad); this means that you have smal reduction of the data, at the cost of increasing the metadata.

It would be useful if you share the information about the metadata/data usage:

# btrfs fi us <mnt>

I suspect that you have a lot of metadata that creates the problem that you are experiencing.

Even tough it should not degenerate to an oom situation.
