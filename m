That's not true, because __filemap_fdatawrite_range will only issue
writeback in case of PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY && the inode's bdi having
BDI_CAP_WRITEBACK. So I think those checks should also be moved to
fdatawrite_wbc.

In fact what would be good for readability since we have a bunch of
__filemap_fdatawrite functions is to have each one call your newly
introduced helper and have their body simply setup the correct
writeback_control structure. Alternative right now one has to chase up
to 3-4 levels of (admittedly very short) functions. I.E

filemap_fdatawrite->__filemap_fdatawrite->__filemap_fdatawrite_range->filemap_fdatawrite_wbc

which is somewhat annoying. Instead I propose having

filemap_fdatawrite->filemap_fdatawrite_wbc
filemap_flush->filemap_fdatawrite_wbc etc...
