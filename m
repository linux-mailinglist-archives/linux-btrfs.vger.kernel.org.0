Which puts pages beyond EOF in the page cache. Given that XFS also
allows persistent block allocation beyond EOF, having both data in the page
cache and blocks beyond EOF that contain unrelated information is a
Real Bad Idea.

Just because putting metadata in the file data address space works
for one filesystem, it doesn't me it's a good idea or that it works
for every filesystem.

No, that's unnecessary.

All we need if for fsverity to require filesystems to pass it byte
addressable data buffers that are externally reference counted. The
filesystem can take a page reference before mapping the page and
passing the kaddr to fsverity, then unmap and drop the reference
when the merkle tree walk is done as per Andrey's new drop callout.

fsverity doesn't need to care what the buffer is made from, how it
is cached, what it's life cycle is, etc. The caching mechanism and
reference counting is entirely controlled by the filesystem callout
implementations, and fsverity only needs to deal with memory buffers
that are guaranteed to live for the entire walk of the merkle
tree....

Cheers,

Dave.
