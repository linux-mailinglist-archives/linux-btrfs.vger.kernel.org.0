I couldn't use a regular inode flag because the btrfs tree checker will
call it an error when it sees a flag it doesn't recognize, regardless of
compat bits or fs read-only status. This is extra painful if the inode
with verity enabled is in a leaf that gets read in at mount time and
gets checked then.

a fake example of what was happening:

mkfs.btrfs dev
mount dev mnt
touch /mnt/foo
fsverity enable /mnt/foo
<reboot to old kernel>
mount dev mnt
!!!FAIL!!!
mount -o ro dev mnt
!!!FAIL!!!

To get around this, I added a new flag field that wasn't checked as
aggressively -- and didn't call it an error on ro mount.

There is more excruciating detail, that I won't poorly re-create here,
in the commit message of:
"btrfs: add ro compat flags to inodes"

However, I really do agree that having done the work to add the new
class of flags, it makes sense to try to take advantage of it the way
you suggest, since per-file ro compat sounds a lot cooler than fs ro
compat. I was just trying to do what I could to make the fs compat bit
work at all.
