After some thinking, I reach the conclusion that devices/ shows the correct
values by mistake :-)

My understanding of a btrfs filesystem bootstrap is the following:

- each time a new block device appears, if this is a valid BTRFS device,
it is registered in a list
- at mount time, BTRFS groups all the devices with the same FS-UUID
- during the mount, it is assumed that if a device has a valid FS-UUID it
is a valid block devices for the filesystem

BTRFS has the following information to detect "foreign" block devices:
1) the UUID of each block devices should match the ones stored in DEV_ITEM (in the metadata)
2) the generation number should match
3) the "num_devices" field of superblock should match the total number of devices

In this case I see two problems:

a) the device was registered but it was unavailable at the time of mounting.
I don't think that it should be considered valid at all and it should be
removed from the list of the available devices when the first access for
check 1) and 2) is tried.
I know that a device can disappear after, but this case is different: if we
can perform 1) and 2) we can classify the device as valid/invalid
If we cannot do (as this case) we can consider it an artifact and discard enterly

b) in any case the check 3) ( 1) and 1) cannot be performed without the device)
should prevent the filesystem to be mounted if num_devices < number of the
listed devices (which is different from the available device). Looking at the
code it seems that only the case of a missing devices is handled
