It might be worth trying to defragment the extent tree of each subvolume by pointing btrfs defrag to the subvolume and not use the -r option. I don't think the btrfsmaintenance script does this.

# btrfs fi defragment /mnt/btrfs 
# btrfs fi defragment /mnt/btrfs/subvol_A
# btrfs fi defragment /mnt/btrfs/subvol_B
...

Read-only snapshots can't be defragmented this way.
