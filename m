I like creating containers directly based on my host system for
development and destructive purposes. It saves space and is incredibly
useful.

But the layered key encryption thing is also core to the encryption
strategy we want to take in Fedora, so I would really like to see this
be possible with Btrfs encryption.

Critically, it means that unlocking a user subvolume will always be
multi-factor: something you have (machine key) and something you know
(user credentials).
