I may be reading more into this than you intended, but this can lead
to some unpleasant surprises.  To ensure predictable behavior, the
allocator should _always_ select devices based on configured priority.
If no devices meet the configured requirements, the chunk allocator
should return ENOSPC immediately, rather than silently falling back to
something not explicitly permitted.

We should never allocate metadata on slower devices simply because faster
ones are full.  That must be _explicitly_ allowed by the configuration.

There are some interesting proposals based on the allocation preferences
patches from 2020.  We might want to hack up the extent allocator so that
extents <= 128K are sent to SSD, while larger extents are sent to HDD.
A maintenance process could run a defrag-like operation periodically
to relocate cold data to slow devices by combining small extents (which
prefer SSD) into large extents (which prefer HDD).

In that case, we'd need at least two preference levels for data block
groups, in addition to a separate preference level for metadata (i.e.
a total of 3 alloc_priority fields per device:  small_data, large_data,
and metadata).

In that case, why bother with ROLE, when PRIORITY (with one priority
value per role) can express a functional superset?

This "default" value was present in earlier versions of the allocation
preferences patch set from 2020.  It was killed because its semantics were
confusing--users had to read the doc to understand what it did, then asked
questions about why there are two options that are equivalent to "data
preferred, metadata allowed", but behave differently in a filesystem
because they have different numeric values in the device sort.

In other words, the problem is not just the name--it's the _concept_ of
"default" being a distinct value, as opposed to an alias for one of the
non-default values.  There's no way a device can have a "default" or
"other" role in the presence of any device with a non-default role--a
device that merely participates in allocation potentially modifies the
result of every allocation.

Instead, we picked "data preferred" (which is "role=data" in your
proposal) as the default.  This compromise achieves two key goals:

 * not putting metadata on slow drives when fast drives exist, and
 * not running out of metadata space, by allowing metadata allocation
   on data devices as a last resort.

That said, there could be a distinct on-disk encoding for "default"
or "unspecified", as long as it maps exactly to one of the explicit
choices at runtime, i.e. it must not have a distinct numeric value in the
ordering.  I think the point is moot, though, since there's no need to put
role on disk at all, and alloc_priority can simply default to zero.

To clarify, I propose independent priorities for each allocation type on a
device.  For example, a device would maintain separate priority values for
data and metadata, and future extensions like write_cache, small_extent, etc.
(For the purpose of this discussion, system is part of metadata.)

struct btrfs_dev_item {
        ...
        union {
            __le64 type;              /* unused */
            struct {
                __le8 reserved[6];
                __le8 prio_metadata;  /* bits 8 - 15: metadata priority */
                __le8 prio_data;      /* bits 0 - 07: data priority */
            };
        };
        __le32 dev_group;  /* FT device groups */
        ...
    };

These per-type priorities group devices into tiers for each type.
For different allocation types, devices may be arranged into different
groups.  Within a tier, devices can then be ordered or filtered--using
round-robin, linear placement, FT-domain, or other placement policies--to
satisfy the allocation requirements.

In other words, _devices_ shouldn't have roles--_allocations_ do.

While I'm here...I'm looking at the other alloc_mode bits.  Do we need
any of them?

 * FREE_SPACE: legacy.  Don't need a bit for this--it's the absense of
   all other bits.

 * ROLE: honor role bits.  Don't need this because we can do it better
   by making "role" an attribute of the allocation, and use priority for
   device selection by role.

 * PRIORITY: use raw alloc_priority.  Don't need this bit, because we'll
   always use priority.  The default is zero, and "all devices have
   priority zero" gives current legacy behavior.

 * FT_GROUP: use dev_group for fault domains.  Don't need this because
   it's equivalent to "every dev_group on the filesystem != 0".

The above eliminates all of the bits except:

 * LINEAR: sequential allocation.
 * ROUND-ROBIN: pick the next device.

How do those work if some devices have thee bits set and some are cleared?

It seems to me that it would be better to put LINEAR and ROUND-ROBIN in
a btrfs item, so there's only one item on disk, which describes how
allocations work on disks of the same priority.

This reflects different mental models.  Your approach treats a device's
role as _exclusive_:  if it holds block groups for one role, it cannot be
used for another.  A device can hold metadata but cannot hold write_cache.
As a result, we need special cases like "preferred data with metadata
allowed" because we can't have a single-device filesystem without at
least one mixed role.

In contrast, my model is _inclusive_:  each device can support any
permitted block group type, provided that it assigns a priority to
that type.  Per-type priorities then partition devices into tiers,
letting a device handle data, metadata, write_cache--or any combination
thereof--seamlessly, scaling to 2^N configurations as new roles emerge.

If the user wants exclusive device roles, like "journal only" or "write
cache only", then they can simply set the priorities so that only one
type of chunk is allowed on the device.

Fair point--this example didn't show anything that can't be done with
pure role-based allocations.  Try this with 5 equal-size drives:

 * Device 1:  metadata preference 100, data preference 100
 * Device 2:  metadata preference 100, data preference 100
 * Device 3:  metadata preference 100, data preference 100
 * Device 4:  metadata preference 200, data preference 100
 * Device 5:  metadata preference 200, data preference 100

then put -draid5 -mraid1 on it.

When the sorting for data is "data_only, data, metadata, metadata_only",
and the sorting for metadata is the opposite, it's not possible to get
a 5-device-wide data chunk.

Even with the PRIORITY bit overriding the sort order, each device has only
one priority.  We can solve the above by setting the role for devices
1-3 to 'data_only' and 4-5 to 'data', but we can't solve this for 7
devices with 4 metadata drives when there's two distinct preferences
for the metadata devices.

There need to be two _distinct_ priority values on each device to make
this work.

"Read only" is another misleading name.  Allocations and writes must
still be allowed in existing block groups on these devices.  We are only
preventing the allocation of new block groups.  "None" is a better name
for this, or "no_alloc" or even "no_new".

I went the other way:  from roles to bitmaps, then replaced the bitmaps
with role-specific priority levels to allow userspace full control over
device selection in chunk allocation.  We did this because the concept
of a device role with a single priority was too limiting in practice.

We also found that even with years of experience running with the patches
based on four roles, sysadmins still made errors trying to predict where
data would go.  The priority-driven system is much easier to understand:
data goes where it's allowed, metadata goes where it's allowed, and
when both are allowed, priority rules specify which devices are filled
first.  Devices can be reordered for allocation in a way similar to the
LINEAR mode you propose with priority alone.

Your proposal has some other interesting elements.  The linear and
round-robin modes would work well after sorting devices by FT group
and per-role priority.

I have seen a lot of users request it, but I'm not sure what round-robin
mode is intended to address in practice.  The most significant effect is
that it can cause the filesystem to reach ENOSPC earlier than necessary
if space is not distributed carefully, but users have requested it for
its perceived load-balancing properties.Â Â To work properly, the
allocator needs to store some persistent state to remember the device
it last allocated on--without this, every umount/mount cycle would
reset the allocator, so it would either fill up a low-numbered devid all
the time, or it would behave the same way as legacy btrfs allocation.
This points to a btrfs item as a good place to store all the allocator
configuration and state information, so the allocator can remember where
it was in the round-robin sequence across mounts.

Heh.  Back in 2020 I got different opinions on new items (using the
existing PERSISTENT_ITEM key, but claiming some of the objectid space).
One reviewer wanted to control it via xattrs on the root directory.

On the one hand, using items (or even xattrs) means that schema upgrades
and schema size are practically unlimited.  As long as there's some way
to recognize all the new keys as part of the same feature, we don't need
to burn precious superblock compat bits for each one--the filesystem
would support allocation enhancement or not, and if it did, the kernel
would look into the items to find versioning information.

On the other hand, if the sysadmin has to cope with the cognitive load
of parsing more than 64 bits of different interrelated configuration
settings to predict where the filesystem is going to put its data, the
design places too much burden on users, and risks becoming impractical
from the start.  So there is value in keeping the schema small enough
to fit it all in one u64 in btrfs_dev_item.

This detail of the implementation doesn't matter very much given the
scope proposed so far.  There is room for 7 allocation type priorities
in the u64, today we need only 2, and in 10 years we might use up
to 5 priorities if all proposals I'm aware of are implemented.

If we do run out of bits in a u64 some day, we can always create new
items then.
