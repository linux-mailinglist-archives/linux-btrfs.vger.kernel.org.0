Dear Beloved.

I am General Eleanor from the USA working in the US Army but presently
in Yemen, for a peacekeeping mission, I sincerely apologize for
intruding into your privacy. I have something very important to
discuss with you.
Some money in various currencies where discovered in barrels at a farm
house in the middle East during a rescue operation in Iraq War and it
was agreed by Sergeant Kenneth Buff and myself that some part of these
money be shared between us, I was given a total of ($5 Million US
Dollars) as my own share , I kept this money in a security company for
a long while now which i declared and deposit as my personal and
family treasure and it has been secured and protected for years now
with the security company.

Now, the WAR in Iraq is over, and all possible problems that could
have emanated from the shared money has been totally cleaned up and
all files closed, all what was discovered in the Middle East is no
more discussed, i am ready to retire from active services by the end
of next month, but, i need a trustworthy person that can help me take
possession of this funds and keep it safe while i work on my
retirement letter to join you so that we could discuss possible
business partnership together with the money.
I'll tell you what! No compensation can make up for the risk we are
taking with our lives.You can confirm the genuineness of the findings
by clicking on this website.

I=E2=80=99m seeking your kind assistance to move the sum of US$5 Million
Dollars to you as long as you will assure me that the money will be
safe in your care until I complete my service here in (Yemen) before
the end of next month.
The most important thing is; =E2=80=9CCan I Trust you=E2=80=9D?As an office=
r on ACTIVE
DUTY I am not allowed to have access to money, therefore, I have
declared the content of the consignment as personal and my treasure. I
would like to deliver to you. You will be rewarded with 30% of this
funds for your assistance, all that I require is your mutual trust
between us. Don't betray me when you receive the consignment.

Sincerely,
General Eleanor.
