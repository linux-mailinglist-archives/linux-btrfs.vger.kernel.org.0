A solution for that already exists.  It's called btrfs snapshots.  Which you
probably already know, since it's probably what you're using :-)

Using overlayfs would simply mean that each container consists of an upper and
lower directory instead of a single directory.  Either or both could still be
btrfs subvolumes.  They could even be on the same subvolume.

That's possible with the existing fscrypt semantics.  Just use a unique master
key for each container, and protect it with a key derived from both the machine
key *and* the user credential.  Protecting the fscrypt master key(s) is a
userspace problem, not a kernel one.  The kernel just receives the raw key.
