Ramadan Kareem to you,

My name is Bukuri Dervishi, I=E2=80=99m a citizen of Albania base in Turkey
for my previous business. This is a confidential message, I have lost
two of my children due to covid19; early February we came to Italy on
visit without knowing that things was about to fall appart. Not only
did my children die as a result of covid19; I also tested
positive, and it has defied all forms of medical treatment,

I may have only a few days to live, as a result of that I want to
donate my entire Money thirteen million five hundred and eighty
thousand usd($13,580 million usd) to you for charity work as my
promise to God since I will not be needing the money any more. I'm
donating the money to you because I do not have any other heir and my
trusted Steward who would have handly this assignment is incapable due
to old age and ill health.

I am given you 40% for this job while you are to give 20% to my former
Steward and donate the remaining 40% for charitable works such as to
donate 20% towards the fight of coronavirus and 20% to the less
priviledges in the society. I will give you
more details on how to get the money. Kindly let me know if you are
capable to handle this,and if you can=E2=80=99t please kindly reject the
offer.

Thanks and stay safe
Regards
Bukuri Dervishi.
