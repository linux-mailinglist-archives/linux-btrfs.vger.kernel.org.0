Greetings dear,

I am writing this mail with tears and grief and am looking for your
help due to my medical situation here in London. I am Mrs. Tytti
Korhonen, a Finnish citizen and 83 years old. I was an orphan, adopted
by my late father Engr. Pekka Korhonen, Chairman / CEO of
Pekkakorhonen Oil and Gas Services. After my father's death, I took
over his management and also decided not to get married because I am
his only child.

Since then, I have had a coronary artery disease that has cost me a
lot and has affected every part of my body and brain cells due to
complications. Only 5 days ago, the British doctors told me that I
could die at any time because my condition had reached a critical and
life-threatening stage. After knowing my medical critical status, I
decided to use your urgent help / collaboration to use my $14.5
million legacy and build orphanages in memory of me when I'm gone.

I made this brave decision because I don't have a husband, family, or
kids who can inherit this money when I'm gone. If you are interested,
take 30% of the total money for your help and build orphanages with
the rest in memory of me. If you are interested, please contact me
urgently for more information. I will issue my father's payment
certificate and death certificate for confirmation before we identify
you as my legal beneficiary for receiving the money on my behalf.

I am waiting to hear from you urgently.

Best regards,
Mrs. Tytti Korhonen.
