This is very useful, thank you! Running scrubs on three devices with
10M/20M/30M bandwidth limit showed up in iotop/nmon exactly as expected,
and dynamically changing the values to speed up/slow down also worked
right away - very nice.

My only suggestion would be:

..for this to be in megabytes only (maybe also renaming scrub_speed_max to
scrub_speed_max_mb?), because otherwise everyone will forget the unit and wonder
why scrub is running with 50 bytes/sec. IMHO bytes/kbytes are not really practical
scrub speeds. Other than that have a:
