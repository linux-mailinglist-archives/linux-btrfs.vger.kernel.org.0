So, fscrypt originally only supported per-file keys.  The reason we added
support for some "one key per encryption policy" settings are because there are
cases where many keys can't be handled efficiently.  In the case of Adiantum
encryption (which is intended for devices which might not have a lot of memory)
a key takes a lot of memory, so we didn't want to have one for every file.
Similarly, in the case where file contents encryption is done using UFS or eMMC
inline encryption hardware rather than in software, there might be only a small
number of hardware keyslots and changing them can be slow, so we didn't want to
have to change keys for every file.

There are definitely some advantages to per-file keys, including reducing the
amount of data which is encrypted with each key, increasing the difficulty of
recovering deleted files, and eliminating the need to distinguish between
different files in the IVs.

None of these are too important in practice, though.  E.g. we don't get anywhere
near the cryptographic bounds in practice anyway, and secure deletion isn't
guaranteed even with per-file keys.

For btrfs, it sounds like per-file keys won't work out due to reflinks anyway.
However you could do per-extent keys in the same way, where the key for each
extent is derived from a nonce (stored in the metadata describing the extent)
and the master key.

Did you consider per-extent keys?  If they are practical, that would be the best
approach cryptographically.  But if they aren't practical (more likely IMO,
given that a file can contain a large number of extents), I think it would be
acceptable to not use them.
