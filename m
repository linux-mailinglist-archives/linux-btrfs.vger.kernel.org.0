Right, I left the code flipping balance->paused opencoded because that's
really a special case. By all means I can add a specific helper so that
the ASSERT is not lost as well. The reason I didn't do it in the first
place is because PAUSED is really "special" in the sense it can be
entered only from BALANCE and it's not really generic. If you take a
look how btrfs_exclop_start does it for example, it simply checks we
don't have a running op and simply sets it to whatever is passed

That got me thinking in the first place and actually initially I had a
patch which removed it. However, I *think* it might be required since
exclusive_operation is accessed without a lock ini the sysfs code i.e.
btrfs_exclusive_operation_show so I guess that's why we need it.

Goldwyn, what's your take on this?

I'm having a hard time seeing how this would increase readability. What
should go into the __btrfs_exclop_finish function?
