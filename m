Â­Hi All,

I am looking for a way to make a raid 1 of two SSD's, and to be able to detect corrupted blocks, much like btrfs does that. I recall being told about a month ago to use a specific piece of software for that, but i forgot to make a note of it, and I can't find it anymore.

What's that called?

Cheers,
Cedric
