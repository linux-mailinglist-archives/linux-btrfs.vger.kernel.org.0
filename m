Hey.

memtest[0] showed, that in fact memory is damaged in some higher region... as you've guessed, its always a single but flip.

Sure. I've had understood that. What I've meant was to find out how much of the file (or, if more were affected, which files) was not guaranteed to be integrity protected, because its csum data is broken.

It's still a bit strange, though, because I most likely had run a scrub since then,  and no errors were found...

But in principle, scrub should notice these corruptions in the csum tree, shouldn't it?

That I don't understand. You mean the csum tree isn't read/written in that region (i.e. not unless the associated files are read)... and that's why it went so long unnoticed?

Ok... if both works to find out files are affected (in the sense that they cannot be verified because the csum is broken... and thus may or may not be valid)... then I guess that's the easiest way for me to recover.

So in principle,  since my tar yesterday brought no further errors,  the should result in only that one file.

Ah, OK. 


Thanks,
Chris.

[0] For those who haven't seen yet,  there's pcmemtest (https://github.com/martinwhitaker/pcmemtest) which is a fork off (or based upon memtest86+)... but with UEFI support, which memtest86+ cannot be used with.
