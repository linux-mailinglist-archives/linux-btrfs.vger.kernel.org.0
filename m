Â­I would like to create a btrfs raid array where one device (either hard drive, SSD or flash drive) can fail, and all the data survives.
Also, I would like to have a write cache in front of all the mechanical drives, so they can stay idle until the write cache if full, or data is requested that is not in the read cache.

I've looked at bcache. This can cache multiple block devices with a single read cache, but it cannot be stacked [1], so I cannot give each hard drive it's own (small) write cache, with a shared large read cache like this:

Would it be a good idea to use dm-cache to create pairs of hard drives and flash drives, and then use bcache on top of that to create a big shared read cache like this?

Will this stack survive a drive that goes missing? For instance by pulling out the data cable or the power cable of that drive?
Will this stack survive a drive that is silently corrupting data? For instance by dd'ing random data to it?

How would you solve this problem?
