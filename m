I was still having performance issues even with this patch. Shouldn't be
too hard to reproduce. E.g., I have a ~10GB sqlite db with 1236459
extents (as dbs tend to have on btrfs). Sending that (even with only two
snapshots) causes it to be cpu limited.

So I went ahead and continued to use the patch that disables backref
walking in send (for the db above the backref walking doesn't do
anything anyway), but use it in combination with "--no-data" to read
file data and then dedup in user space (only whole file dedup for now).
This is all a bit application specific. Is anyone interested in the code?
