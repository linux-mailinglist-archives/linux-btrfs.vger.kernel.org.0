Dear Friend.


Greetings to you in the name of the Lord God Almighty am MRS. JULIET
MAROIS From (Paris) France, but am based in Burkina Faso Africa for
eight years now as a business woman dealing on gold exportation and
cotton Sales. But I have been suffering from this deadly disease
called cancer for long and the doctor just said I have just few days
to leave. I know it will be difficult for you to believe my story now,
but this is the situation I found myself in, it=E2=80=99s not my desire to =
be
on a sick bed today but God knows best,

Now that I am about to end the race like this, without any family
Members and no child. I have $5.8 Million US DOLLARS in BANK OF AFRICA
(B.O.A) Burkina Faso it=E2=80=99s all my life savings, I instructed the Ban=
k
to give it to St Andrews Missionary and Home Kizito Orphanage in
Burkina Faso. But my mind is not at rest because i do not trust them,
I am writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside my
sick bed.

I will instruct the bank to transfer this fund to you as a foreigner
but you have to promise me that you will take 40 Percent(%) of the
total money for your personal use While 60 Percent (%) of the money
will go to charity, Orphanages and less Privileges" people in the
street and helping the Needed. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have
anybody as my family member, just to Endeavour that the house of God
is maintained. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and
accept my soul because these sicknesses have suffered me so much.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
bank and I will also instruct my Bank Manger to issue you an authority
letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of the money in the
bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly as I
Stated herein.


I look forward to getting a reply from you.

Thanks and God bless you,

MRS JULIET MAROIS.
