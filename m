Greetings

My Name is Mrs. Maile .(A) Roberto, from Norway. I know that this message
will be a surprise to you. Firstly, I am married to Mr. Patrick Roberto,
A gold merchant who owns a small gold mine in Madrid   Spain; He died of
Cardiovascular Disease in mid-March 2011. During his lifetime he
deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 8.5 Million Euro) Eight million, Five hundre=
d
thousand Euros in a HSBC Bank  in Madrid the capital city of Spain.
The deposited money was from the sale of the
shares, death benefits payment and entitlements of my deceased
husbandry his company.

I am sending this message to you praying that it will reach you in
good health since I am not in good health condition in which I sleep
every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I
am suffering from long time cancer and presently I am partially
suffering from a stroke illness which has become almost impossible for
me to move around. I am married to my late husband for over 4 years
before he died and is unfortunate that we don't have a child, my
doctor confided in me that I have less chance to live. Having known my
health condition, I decided to contact you to claim the fund since I
don't have any relation I grew up from an orphanage home.

I have decided to donate what I have to you for the support of helping
Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and
diagnosed with cancer for about 2 years ago. I have been touched by
God Almighty to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband
to you for the good work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to
forgive me and believe he has because He is a Merciful God, I will be
going in for an operation surgery soon

This is the reason I need your services to stand as my next of kin or
the executor to claim the funds for charity purposes. If this money
remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the
government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for
selfish and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can
claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows
and also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my
late husband and my name; I need your urgent answer to know if you
will be able to execute this project, and I will give you more
information on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account.

Thanks
Mrs. Maile .(A) Roberto
