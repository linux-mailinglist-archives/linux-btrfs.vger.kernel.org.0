It seems you misunderstood point (2).  See what I said below:

	So if you do want to implement the DIRECT_KEY method, the natural thing
	to do would be to store a 16-byte nonce along with each extent, and use
	the DIRECT_KEY IV generation method as-is.  It seems that you've done it
	a bit differently; you store a 32-byte nonce and generate the IV as
	'nonce + lblk_num', instead of 'nonce || lblk_num'.  I think that's a
	mistake -- it should be exactly the same.

	If the issue is that the 'nonce || lblk_num' method doesn't allow for
	AES-XTS support, we could extend DIRECT_KEY to do 'nonce + lblk_num'
	*if* the algorithm has a 16-byte IV size and thus has to tolerate some
	chance of IV reuse.  Note that this change would be unrelated to
	extent-based encryption, and could be applied regardless of it.

So:

1.) Provided that you've decided against per-extent keys, and are not trying to
    support UFS and eMMC inline encryption hardware, then you should *only*
    support DIRECT_KEY -- not other settings that don't make sense.

2.) There should be a preparatory patch that makes DIRECT_KEY be allowed when
    the IV length is 16 bytes, using the method 'nonce + lblk_num' -- assuming
    that you need AES-XTS support and aren't planning on supporting Adiantum or
    AES-HCTR2 only.  (The small chance for IV reuse that it results in is not
    ideal, but it's probably tolerable.  Maybe the nonce should also be hashed
    with a secret key, like what IV_INO_LBLK_32 does with the inode number; I'll
    have to think about it.)  If you plan to just support AES-HCTR2 instead of
    AES-XTS, then you'd need a patch to allow AES-HCTR2 for contents encryption,
    as currently it is only allowed for filenames.

3.) Each extent context should contain a 16-byte random nonce, that is newly
    generated just for that extent -- not copied from anywhere.

4.) IVs should be generated using the DIRECT_KEY method.  That is,
    'nonce || lblk_num' if the IV length allows it, otherwise 'nonce + lblk_num'
    as mentioned in (2).  For inode-based encryption, nonce means the inode's
    nonce, and lblk_num means the index of the block in the inode.  For
    extent-based encryption, nonce will mean the extent's nonce, and lblk_num
    will mean the index of the block in the extent.
