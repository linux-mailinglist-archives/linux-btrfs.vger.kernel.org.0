Thanks, now the following needed dumps:

# btrfs ins dump-tree --hide-names -b 3766932439040 /dev/vdf

And

# btrfs ins dump-tree --hide-names -t 5 /dev/vdf |\
   grep "(407482430 " -C 5

The first one is to dump the content of that log tree.

The second one is to dump the original tree of that offending directory 
inode.

With those two (and hopefully the only needed dumps), we should be able 
to pin down the cause.

But it's better to let Filipe to determine if extra info is needed.

Thanks,
Qu
