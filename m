"Loading the parent dir's fscrypt_info" isn't relevant here, since the filenames
encryption mode can be different from the contents encryption mode.  It's also
possible for an encrypted file to be located in an unencrypted directory.  Maybe
you meant to be talking about the file itself being opened?

Anyway, crypto_alloc_skcipher() takes a lock (crypto_alg_sem) under which memory
is allocated with GFP_KERNEL.  So neither preloading kernel modules nor
memalloc_nofs_save() helps for it; it's still not GFP_NOFS-safe.

I don't think we should allow files to have extents with different encryption
modes.  Encryption policies will still be a property of files.

It probably should be global, or at least per-master-key, as it would be a
massive overhead to allocate (e.g.) 128 crypto_skcipher objects for every file.
blk-crypto-fallback uses a global cache.

It does introduce a bottleneck and memory that can't be reclaimed, though.  I'd
appreciate any thoughts about other solutions.  Maybe the number of objects in
the cache could be scaled up and down as the number of in-core inodes changes.

I think that we should definitely still cache the per-file key in
inode::i_crypt_info and not in some global cache.
