memalloc_nofs_save()/memalloc_nofs_restore() could do the job of making 
sure allocations use GFP_NOFS, I think? I guess those calls should be in 
fscrypt_load_extent_info() instead of just in the doc...

I didn't elaborate why it wasn't here and should have. With just this 
patchset, I thought a file only ever has extents with the same 
encryption mode, since an inode can't change encryption mode/key past 
creation at present . So loading the parent dir's fscrypt_info should be 
enough to ensure the module is loaded for the mode of all the extents. I 
suppose I'd need to ensure that reflinks also only reflink extents 
sharing the same encryption mode.

In the future patchset which allows changing the key being used for new 
extents (naming that is hard), I had envisioned requiring the filesystem 
to provide a list of enc modes used by an inode when opening, and then 
fscrypt_file_open() could make sure all the necessary modules are loaded 
for those modes.

Could we use a mempool of skciphers for all of fscrypt, or should it 
only be for extents and be on a per-file basis?

Same question: just for extent infos, or can this be generalized to all 
infos?

Interesting. I will have to study that more, thanks for the pointer.

Thank you!
