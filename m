In order to understand those numbers and interpret them correctly you
need to understand how btrfs manages its memory. Essentially we take a
linear device (or multiple devices, but for this example it will be
linear) and we split them in Metadata/Data chunks (this is what the
Metadata/Data mean above). I will ignore system as it's not important.


Respectively metadata/data writes would go to the respective space. For
example say you want to write 4megabytes if there are no free data
groups i.e total == used in the "DATA" line we'd allocate a data block
group with a size of 1gb, so now total would be 1g larger than Used, and
we'll be able to write our 4 megabytes. Now what happens in this case is
that we've allocated 1 gigabyte for data and only used 4 megabytes of
it, in this case you might argue we are wasting the rest of the 996
megabytes. However, if you want to write further data you'd be able to
do so within those 996megabytes, after they are exhausted btrfs will go
and fetch another chunk of 1 gigabytes. This works the same way for
metadata.


So based on the numbers above you have a device whose actual physical
size is 420 gigabytes, of it 372 are allocated i.e split among
data/metadata groups, but only 350 giigabytes of those 372 which are
allocated are used. Looking further we can see that you have 9gb of
metadata allocated and only 7.1g of this is used. BY the same logic you
have 361g of data allocated, but only 343 used.

And you have close to 40g of "unallocated" space i.e one which is not
dedicated to either data or metadata. So that's a healthy filesystem state.

The reason why you'd want to run balance is if you have some
pathological workload which creates a lot of blockgroups of either type
(Data/Metadata) but which are sparsely populated. For example you write
a bunch of files which cause the FS to allocate 100g (i.e 100
blockgroups) for data, then you free 95% of every block group. The end
result would be you will have 100 blockgroup but only 5 of each is going
to be populated, the rest of the space is going to be "wasted" because
it is dedicated for data but you are not using it AT THE MOMENT, this
doesn't mean you won't use it in the future. This situation can become
problematic if you run out of unallocated space and your workload
requires you to allocated a metadata chunk, in this case the filesystem
might give you an ENOSPC error because it will see that there is no
unallocated space but in reality you could squash those 100, very
lightly used blockgroup into 1 or 2 almost full block group which would
render the rest of the space "unallocated", meaning it can be used for
either data/metadata.

Does that answer your question?
