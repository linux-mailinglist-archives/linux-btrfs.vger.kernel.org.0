Good question, now I'm thinking if 'devices' show the currently
available devices to the filesystem, whilst 'devinfo' is supposed to
show what devices the fs knows about. So in the case of degraded mount
it should really have 2 devices under devinfo and only 1 under device.
But this also means the case you reported shouldn't be handled by the
devinfo sysfs code but rather the admin should do 'btrfs device scan -u'
to remove the stale device.


I'd say this is all pretty open to interpretation so I'd like to also
see David's and Josef's opinions on this.
