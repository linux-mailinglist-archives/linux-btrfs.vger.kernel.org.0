I overlooked this option because my gut instinct was that the memory
usage would be prohibitive. It looks like one AES-256-XTS prepared key
is about 1k in memory (960 bytes for the encryption and decryption key
schedules for each key, plus a bit more for the crypto API structures).
I thought it'd be too expensive to store this naively for each cached
extent.

However, across various machines I checked, the number of cached inodes
and the number of cached extents is in the same order magnitude (and in
fact, almost equal in many cases). So per-extent keys aren't out of the
question. We can store a 16-byte nonce in the extent, use that to derive
the per-extent key from the master key, and use the offset in the extent
as the IV. I'll think about it some more and make sure I'm not missing
anything.

We already store a checksum per block; I don't see any reason that it
couldn't be a MAC. Johannes Thumshirn had a proof of concept for storing
an HMAC for all blocks:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20191015121405.19066-1-jthumshirn@suse.de/#b
Plumbing it through for authenticated encryption would be a little
harder, but probably not by much.

Since there's no such thing as "reflinking" filenames, I think filename
encryption can be unchanged, i.e., per-directory encryption keys. (This
would probably be the case with per-extent keys for data, as well.)

On disk, we still only need to store the usual fscrypt context. It will
always be present for the top-level of the snapshot. It may or may not
be present for any files or directories under that.

In memory, we'd store whether the subvolume is encrypted. This would be
set when enabling encryption and when caching the subvolume. Since every
inode has a reference to the subvolume it is in, and inodes can't move
between subvolumes, all we need is a check like:

if (IS_ENCRYPTED(inode->subvolume) && !IS_ENCRYPTED(inode))
	set_up_encryption(inode);

I'm leaning towards doing that either at the time that userspace writes
the data, or at the time that we're flushing the data to disk, whichever
ends up being more convenient for Btrfs. I'd rather not do it at open
time.

Thanks for the very helpful reply!
