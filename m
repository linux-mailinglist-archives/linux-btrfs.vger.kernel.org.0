I don't think it's a good idea, if a new fs without swapfile support is
tested by fstests, test would get false failure, where it should
_notrun. And making a generic requirement check to fs-specific doesn't
seem quite right either.

As Brian mentioned in his review, we're in the process to convert all
shared tests to generic or fs-specific tests (very slow though), that
said we don't want new shared tests.

I think we could whitelist fs types in _require_scratch_swapfile() and
don't _notrun for such filesystems, something like what we did in
_fstyp_has_non_default_seek_data_hole(), so that we won't miss silent
regressions on sucn filesystems, and we'll do sanity check as well on
other filesystems.

I have a patch[1] that should fix the issue 3 years ago, but it never
got reviewed, would you please check and see if it fixed the bug for you?

Thanks,
