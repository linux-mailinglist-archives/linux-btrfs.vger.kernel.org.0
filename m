Subject: [PATCH v2 2/3] Btrfs: fix race between block group removal and block group creation
Date:   Mon,  1 Jun 2020 19:12:19 +0100

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

There is a race between block group removal and block group creation
when the removal is completed by a task running fitrim or scrub. When
this happens we end up failing the block group creation with an error
-EEXIST since we attempt to insert a duplicate block group item key
in the extent tree. That results in a transaction abort.

The race happens like this:

1) Task A is doing a fitrim, and at btrfs_trim_block_group() it freezes
   block group X with btrfs_freeze_block_group() (until very recently
   that was named btrfs_get_block_group_trimming());

2) Task B starts removing block group X, either because it's now unused
   or due to relocation for example. So at btrfs_remove_block_group(),
   while holding the chunk mutex and the block group's lock, it sets
   the 'removed' flag of the block group and it sets the local variable
   'remove_em' to false, because the block group is currently frozen
   (its 'frozen' counter is > 0, until very recently this counter was
   named 'trimming');

3) Task B unlocks the block group and the chunk mutex;

4) Task A is done trimming the block group and unfreezes the block group
   by calling btrfs_unfreeze_block_group() (until very recently this was
   named btrfs_put_block_group_trimming()). In this function we lock the
   block group and set the local variable 'cleanup' to true because we
   were able to decrement the block group's 'frozen' counter down to 0 and
   the flag 'removed' is set in the block group.

   Since 'cleanup' is set to true, it locks the chunk mutex and removes
   the extent mapping representing the block group from the mapping tree;

5) Task C allocates a new block group Y and it picks up the logical address
   that block group X had as the logical address for Y, because X was the
   block group with the highest logical address and now the second block
   group with the highest logical address, the last in the fs mapping tree,
   ends at an offset corresponding to block group X's logical address (this
   logical address selection is done at volumes.c:find_next_chunk()).

   At this point the new block group Y does not have yet its item added
   to the extent tree (nor the corresponding device extent items and
   chunk item in the device and chunk trees). The new group Y is added to
   the list of pending block groups in the transaction handle;

6) Before task B proceeds to removing the block group item for block
   group X from the extent tree, which has a key matching:

   (X logical offset, BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY, length)

   task C while ending its transaction handle calls
   btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(), which finds block group Y and
   tries to insert the block group item for Y into the exten tree, which
   fails with -EEXIST since logical offset is the same that X had and
   task B hasn't yet deleted the key from the extent tree.
   This failure results in a transaction abort, producing a stack like
   the following:

Fix this simply by making btrfs_remove_block_group() remove the block
group's item from the extent tree before it flags the block group as
removed. Also make the free space deletion from the free space tree
before flagging the block group as removed, to avoid a similar race
with adding and removing free space entries for the free space tree.

V2: Rebased on 5.8 changes, as there was an interfering cleanup.
    Previous version applies to 5.7.
