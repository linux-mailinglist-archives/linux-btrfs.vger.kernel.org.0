A fair point. Can move the penalty to open or write time instead though: 
btrfs could store a generation number with the new context on only the 
directory changed, then leaf inodes or new extent can traverse up the 
directory tree and grab context from the highest-generation-number 
directory in its path to inherit from. Or btrfs could disallow changing 
except on the base of a subvolume, and just go directly to the top of 
the subvolume to grab the appropriate context. Neither of those require 
recursion outside btrfs.

Hardly; a quite intriguing idea. Let me think about this with folks when 
we get back to work on Wednesday. Not sure how it goes with the other 
usecase, the base image/per-machine/per-user combo, but will think about it.
