Sorry I explained that really badly.

My first try was ro-compat bit only, that failed because btrfs couldn't
add an inode flag in a ro-compat way before my changes, as it could
fail to mount.

To fix that, I had to work on the inode flag compatibility, which
evolved into this notion of inode ro-compat flags, which does work as
expected: if you see a file with an unknown ro-compat flag it's an error
if you aren't read-only. Read-only mount will never fail.

I think changing the semantics of the ro-compat inodes from:
"an unknown ro inode flag -> fs ro" to
"an unknown ro inode flag -> file ro"
could be a big win. I don't think there is a rush to do that, though? If
I add it now, on top of the existing code, then you might go back to a
kernel that can only mount the fs read-only or you might go back to one
which is clever enough to only force the file read-only.

Hope I'm making a bit more sense, now.
