btrfs_exclop_finish would become __btrfs_exclop_finish(type) and do all the
work, but instead of setting NONE it would set type.

Honestly I could go either way, having a helper would make it more readable than
it is, because then its

if (pause)
	btrfs_exclop_pause();
else
	btrfs_exclop_finish();

I'm not strong on this, I think having a helper instead of open coding helps
given the number of places it's used.  Perhaps just doing that step will make it
clean enough.  Thanks,

Josef
