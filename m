It's really more about ratio of device speed to size of RAM. Yes the box
I tested on has a lot of drives, but it also has a lot of memory. Hence
the ratio to device speeds and memory size isn't that different from a
normal desktop box with eg 32G of memory, and a flash drive that does
6GB/sec. Obviously reclaim for that smaller box will not be as bad as
the big one, but still.

It's really two fold:

- You want to kick off writeback sooner rather than later. On devices
  these days, it's pretty pointless to let a lot of dirty data build up
  before starting to clean it. Uncached writeback starts when the copy
  is done, rather than many seconds later when some writeback thread
  decides the pressure is either too high, or it's been dirty too long.

- Don't leave things in cache that aren't going to get reused, only to
  get pruned later at the point where you need more memory for the cache
  anyway.

On the read side, if you're not going to be reusing the data you read,
uncached is appropriate. Ditto on the write side, if you're just
flushing out a bunch of data with limted reuse, may as well prune the
cache regions as soon as the write is done, rather than let some kind of
background activity do that when memory becomes scarce.
