There is already a sync just before the master key removal.  See
try_to_lock_evicted_files().  It's racy, of course, as you noticed.

The "soft removal" is what I recommended earlier.  See
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230703181745.GA1194@sol.localdomain and
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230704002854.GA860@sol.localdomain.  I think it's
probably still the way to go, but I was a bit confused by the way that Sweet Tea
had implemented it.  Maybe it can be simplified?

I've been pretty busy this week; I'll take a look at your latest patches soon.
I've gone ahead and tweaked your patch "fscrypt: rename fscrypt_info =>
fscrypt_inode_info" a bit and applied it to the fscrypt tree for 6.7 so that we
can get it out of the way; let me know if that's okay.  I've just sent out the
version that I applied.  BTW, I also applied my patchset "fscrypt: add support
for data_unit_size < fs_block_size" recently, so you'll need to rebase onto the
fscrypt tree anyway.  Sorry for the churn, but that feature is apparently
something that people need...
