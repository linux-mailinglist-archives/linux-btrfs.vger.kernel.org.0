Thanks Josef!  At a high level this looks good to me.  It's much simpler.  I
guess my main question is "what is missing" (besides the obvious things like
updating the documentation and polishing code comments).  I see you got rid of a
lot of the complexity in Sweet Tea's patchset, which is great as I think a lot
of it was unnecessary as I've mentioned.  But maybe something got overlooked?
I'm mainly wondering about the patches like "fscrypt: allow asynchronous info
freeing" that were a bit puzzling but have now gone away.

Not supporting v1 encryption policies is the right call, I think.  xfstests will
need to be updated to not assume that v1 is always supported, but that's
something I've been thinking about doing anyway.

The patch that adds support for checksumming the on-disk data is new.  I see why
it's needed.  I suppose that's just been overlooked until now?  It's definitely
correct that you need to checksum the ciphertext, not the plaintext.  Otherwise
the checksums leak information about the plaintext.

Did you consider the idea I mentioned at the end of
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230907055233.GB37146@sol.localdomain where we store
a full fscrypt_context per extent, but for now validate that it matches the
inode's context (minus the nonce) and only support that case?

I guess the reasons to do that would be (1) futureproofing, (2) error checking
to catch any bugs where an extent might be accessed inconsistently, and (3)
making extents "standalone" so that they can be decrypted by anything that
iterates through the extents only (e.g. btrfs scrub as mentioned by Sweet Tea;
though, how will scrub even have access to the encryption keys?).  I don't have
a great sense of how strong these reasons actually are, so any thoughts would be
appreciated.  If just the nonce is really all that's needed, then that's fine
too.  The point is, the part I was concerned about wasn't really whether the key
identifier and encryption settings get stored per extent, but rather whether we
actually support the case where these differ from the inode's.

(And by "the inode" I really mean "the inode that owns the extent cache entry
the extent is being accessed through".  It's the case that when an extent is
shared by multiple inodes, it gets a cache entry for each one, right?)
