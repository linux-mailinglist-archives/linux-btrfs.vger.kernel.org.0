Well, all the other filesystems that support fsverity (ext4, f2fs, and btrfs)
just cache the Merkle tree pages in the inode's page cache.  It's an approach
that I know some people aren't a fan of, but it's efficient and it works.

We could certainly think about moving to a design where fs/verity/ asks the
filesystem to just *read* a Merkle tree block, without adding it to a cache, and
then fs/verity/ implements the caching itself.  That would require some large
changes to each filesystem, though, unless we were to double-cache the Merkle
tree blocks which would be inefficient.

So it feels like continuing to have the filesystem (not fs/verity/) be
responsible for the cache is the best way to allow XFS to do things a bit
differently, without regressing the other filesystems.

I'm interested in hearing any other proposals, though.
