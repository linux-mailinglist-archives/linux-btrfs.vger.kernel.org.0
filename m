Neat, thanks!

Runqueue depth seems to be very rarely greater than 1, tasks with ~1ms
runtime and lots of sleeping (also bursty kworker activity with activations
of tens of Âµs), and some cores (Internet tells me that Xeon Bronze 3204
doesn't have SMT) spend most of their time idling. Not the most apocalyptic
task placement vs ILB selection, but the task activation patterns roughly
look like what I was thinking of - there might be hope for me yet.

I'll continue the headscratching after tomorrow's round of thinking juice.
