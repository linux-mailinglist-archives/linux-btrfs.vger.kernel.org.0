I want to mention the btrfs verity support in
Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst, and I have a couple questions:

1. Is the ro_compat filesystem flag still a thing?  The commit message claims it
   is, and BTRFS_FEATURE_COMPAT_RO_VERITY is defined in the code, but it doesn't
   seem to actually be used.  It's not needed since you found a way to make the
   inode flags ro_compat instead, right?

2. Is there a minimum version of btrfs-progs that is required to use btrfs
   verity?  With ext4 and f2fs, the fsck tools had to be updated, so there were
   minimum versions of the userspace tools required.

Thanks,

- Eric
