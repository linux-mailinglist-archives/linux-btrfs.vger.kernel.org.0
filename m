Update:

Ok, mounting as read-only seems to have done the trick (for now). At 
least it looks like I'm able to btrfs send snapshots to my new server 
without the RAM increasing.

How can I avoid this sort of thing in the future? Not using 
deduplication tools on snapshots? Only deleting one snapshot at a time 
and wait until I no longer see a btrfs-cleaner process?
