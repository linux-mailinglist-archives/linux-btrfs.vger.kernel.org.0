Looking at this again, I think this patch makes things worse, not better.  The
diffstat is significantly positive, and it splits the handling of each policy
type into several more places, which makes it harder to understand how each one
works.  Also problematic is how the new code makes it look like HKDF context 0
is potentially used, which could confuse people trying to review the crypto.

Do any of your later patches depend on this patch?
