Well, IPE is not upstream, and it duplicates functionality that already exists
upstream (IMA appraisal).  So from an upstream perspective it doesn't really
matter currently.  That's interesting that you've already deployed IPE in
production anyway.  To re-iterate my question at
https://lore.kernel.org/r/YqKGcdM3t5gjqBpq@sol.localdomain which was ignored,
can you elaborate on why IPE should exist when IMA appraisal already exists (and
already supports fsverity), and why IPE uses the fsverity builtin signatures?
And are you sure that X.509 and PKCS#7 should be used in a new system?  These
days, if you go through any sort of crypto or security review, you will be told
not to use those formats since they are overly complex and prone to bugs.
