 :Q: Does fs-verity support remote filesystems?
-:A: Only ext4 and f2fs support is implemented currently, but in
-    principle any filesystem that can store per-file verity metadata
-    can support fs-verity, regardless of whether it's local or remote.
-    Some filesystems may have fewer options of where to store the
-    verity metadata; one possibility is to store it past the end of
-    the file and "hide" it from userspace by manipulating i_size.  The
-    data verification functions provided by ``fs/verity/`` also assume
-    that the filesystem uses the Linux pagecache, but both local and
