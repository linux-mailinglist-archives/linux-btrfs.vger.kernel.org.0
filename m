So you want to call the structure btrfs_bio and add build protections?  I'm not
sure how exactly you want to do the sizeof check, one way would be to add a
stub structure and compare sizeof against that, because a hardcoded value won't
work due to padding, or we'd have to have a 32bit assertion version.

I'd like to see the code, but otherwise I think it's reasonable, the shorter
name would be better. I don't expect many backports regarding the bio
related code, it could be referenced in the diff context but that we can
handle fine. I'm a bit cautious because I've seen patches to other
subystems that did changes like swapping parameters or repurposing
structures like here we do and Linus did not like that at all. It's
trade off if we'll suffer a naming we don't like or would cause a bug
because we'd forget about the change.
