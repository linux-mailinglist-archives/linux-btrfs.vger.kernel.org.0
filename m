5) Have a new subvol flag and only reset received uuid on ro -> rw if this new subvol flag is set. At this point it is completely backwards compatible (if older kernels ignore unknown subvol flags?). Then change btrfs-progs to set this flag during receive (under whatever policy btrfs-progs has for backwards-compatibility). Maybe only for v2 streams but that might further delay the transition. btrfs_ioctl_received_subvol_args even has an already existing flags member.
