From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

fsverity builtin signatures, at least as currently implemented, are a
mistake and should not be used.  They mix the authentication policy
between the kernel and userspace, which is not a clean design and causes
confusion.  For builtin signatures to actually provide any security
benefit, userspace still has to enforce that specific files have
fsverity enabled.  Since userspace needs to do this, a better design is
to have that same userspace code do the signature check too.

That allows better signature formats and algorithms to be used, avoiding
in-kernel parsing of the notoriously bad PKCS#7 format.  It is also
needed anyway when different keys need to be trusted for different
files, or when it's desired to use fsverity for integrity-only or
auditing on some files and for authenticity on other files.  Basically,
the builtin signatures don't work for any nontrivial use case.

(IMA appraisal is another alternative.  It goes in the opposite
direction -- the full policy is moved into the kernel.)

For these reasons, the master branch of AOSP no longer uses builtin
signatures.  It still uses fsverity for some files, but signatures are
verified in userspace when needed.

None of the public uses of builtin signatures outside Android seem to
have gotten going, either.  Support for builtin signatures was added to
RPM.  However, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FsVerityRPM was
subsequently rejected from Fedora and seems to have been abandoned.
There is also https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/pull/2269, which was
never merged.  Neither proposal mentioned a plan to set
fs.verity.require_signatures=1 and enforce that files have fs-verity
enabled -- so, they would have had no security benefit on their own.

I'd be glad to hear about any other users of builtin signatures that may
exist, and help with the details of what should be used instead.

Anyway, the feature can't simply be removed, due to the need to maintain
backwards compatibility.  But let's at least make it clear that it's
deprecated.  Update the documentation accordingly, and rename the
kconfig option to CONFIG_FS_VERITY_DEPRECATED_BUILTINSIG.  Also remove
the kconfig option from the s390 defconfigs, as it's unneeded there.

+Builtin signature verification (deprecated)
+===========================================

+Authenticating the contents of a file via fs-verity requires (a)

+the file's fs-verity digest is signed by a trusted key.
 
-With CONFIG_FS_VERITY_BUILTIN_SIGNATURES=y, fs-verity supports putting

+Userspace can do both (a) and (b).  Alternatively, the kernel can do

+fs-verity builtin signatures are a hybrid solution where userspace
+handles (a), but the kernel handles (b).  Due to this odd division of
+responsibilities, the inflexibility of doing signature verification in

+be a good way of doing signatures with fs-verity.  Therefore, it is
+**now considered deprecated**.  Users of it should migrate to a better
+solution -- usually userspace signature verification.
 
-2. `FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY`_ accepts a pointer to a PKCS#7 formatted
-   detached signature in DER format of the file's fs-verity digest.
-   On success, this signature is persisted alongside the Merkle tree.
-   Then, any time the file is opened, the kernel will verify the
-   file's actual digest against this signature, using the certificates
-   in the ".fs-verity" keyring.
+That being said, it optionally remains available in the kernel for
+backwards compatibility, and is documented below.
 
-3. A new sysctl "fs.verity.require_signatures" is made available.
-   When set to 1, the kernel requires that all verity files have a
-   correctly signed digest as described in (2).
+CONFIG_FS_VERITY_DEPRECATED_BUILTINSIG=y enables support for the
+deprecated builtin signatures feature.  It makes available the kernel
+keyring ".fs-verity" and the sysctl "fs.verity.require_signatures".
 
-fs-verity file digests must be signed in the following format, which

+certificates from being added.

+When fs-verity is enabled on a file using `FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY`_, a
+pointer to a builtin signature can be provided.  On success, the
+builtin signature is stored internally within the file's fs-verity
+metadata.  The builtin signature must be a PKCS#7 detached signature
