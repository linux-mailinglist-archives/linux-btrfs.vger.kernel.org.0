If we go down that route, it would be nice if we can support a few different
use-cases for various tracers out there.

One use-case (a) requires the ability to query the lock name based on its address as key.
For this a hash table is a good fit. This would allow tracers like ftrace to
output lock names in its human-readable output which is formatted within the kernel.

Another use-case (b) is to be able to "dump" the lock { name, address } tuples
into the trace stream (we call this statedump events in lttng), and do the
translation from address to name at post-processing. This simply requires
that this information is available for iteration for both the core kernel
and module locks, so the tracer can dump this information on trace start
and module load.

Use-case (b) is very similar to what is done for the kernel tracepoints. Based
on this, implementing the init code that iterates on those sections and populates
a hash table for use-case (a) should be easy enough.

Thanks,

Mathieu
