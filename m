From Mr.kevin Roberts

Good day my dear friend.

Sorry for intruding your privacy, I want to discuss with you about
fund and investment for our mutual benefits, I decided to contact you
because I know that you read about this incident about Lewis Tonkinson
from the websites First, I am MR. kevin Roberts, from the United
Kingdom, I am bosom friend to late Pilot Lewis Tonkinson, from West
Bromwich, United Kingdom.

Mr. Lewis Tonkinson was a co-founder of Pinnacle Marketing
Communications which has a registered office in Caroline Street in the
Jewellery Quarter.

Actually, Pilot Lewis Tonkinson and his wife Sally were flying home
with their son when their light aircraft smashed into woodland on 14
April 2016 and they died and left their six-year-old son. Please
Carefully, visit this webpage;

https://www.business-live.co.uk/business/business-news/jewellery-quarter-bu=
sinessman-killed-plane-83868212019/10/02
nyregion=E2=80=BA plane-crash

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3539055/Millionaire-died-alongside=
-wife-plane-crashed-saved-son-s-life-telling-brace-just-seconds-aircraft-pl=
ummeted-trees.html

Therefore, 1=E2=80=99 m contacting you to stand as one of the business
associates to my late client (late Pilot Lewis Tonkinson) because of
his versatile in numerous business partners globally as no one could
questioned, as his only survival son was affected by the Aircraft
Mishap, as the son is among the children with down-syndrome, and UK
Government takes care of him, since the government keep hold of all
his parents investments and most of the investments were willed to
charitable homes.

Furthermore, I will like to present you as the business partner to
late Pilot Lewis Tonkinson, so that we can receive his fund and
personal deposit, worth 3.8 million dollars (Three million eight
hundred thousand United States dollars) he left with a bank here in
USA. I was his close friend before his death, all my effort to get in
contact with his relatives has been futile, because none of the family
members or UK Government have any information about this fund,

and if we could not claim the fund, the bank account of late Pilot
Lewis Tonkinson will be confiscated and the fund transferred to the
treasury account of the bank as an unclaimed fund.

Lastly, due to the fact that my two legs are paralyzed and I am not
much active, So, I want you to work with me to secure this fund for
our mutual benefit; all I require from you is honest co-operation to
enable us to see this transaction through. I guarantee it will be
executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law. Upon your acceptance to this proposal, this
transaction deserves utmost sincerity and confidentiality till the
fund gets transferred into your account.

I await your urgent response indicating your interest.
View appendix for copy of passport for your perusal.
YOU CAN GET BACK TO ME ON MY EMAIL .( mrkevinroberts222211@gmail.com  )
Best Regards,
Mr.kevin Roberts
