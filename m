Okay, so it is used.  (Due to the macro, it didn't show up when grepping.)

Doesn't it defeat the purpose of a ro_compat inode flag if the whole filesystem
is marked with a ro_compat feature flag, though?  I thought that the point of
the ro_compat inode flag is to allow old kernels to mount the filesystem
read-write, with only verity files being forced to read-only.  That would be
more flexible than ext4's implementation of fs-verity which forces the whole
filesystem to read-only.  But it seems you're forcing the whole filesystem to
read-only anyway?
