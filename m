I think what you're saying is that we can't use the device itself 
instead of the snapshot, because mount/unmount change the underlying 
device, and this definitely makes sense.

Looking at other dmlogwrites users, though, generic/482 looks like it 
does something similar, and I don't understand what the difference 
between the replay+snapshot+mount cycles here and the replay+mount 
cycles there. I probably just don't understand what the difference 
between the two tests' scenarios is, though.
