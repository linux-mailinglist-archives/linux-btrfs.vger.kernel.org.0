The RAID5 is not provided by btrfs, but some hardware RAID controller?

Then we don't need to bother the btrfs RAID5 bug.

But still, this means the RAID controller or the hdd is not doing proper =
flush/fua.

This means, next time your UPS went down or a kernel crash happens, you =
may still hit a similar problem.

And this time, we're pretty sure it's less possible to blame btrfs code.

My bad, I mean "btrfs ins dump-super -fFa", but that's for the case of =
btrfs RAID5 setup.

Since you're using hardware RAID5 controller, we can go direct to the =
recovery part.

Your previous find-root output would be pretty helpful.

You can try btrfs-check with -r option:

# btrfs check -r 7939758882816 /dev/sdb1

To see how many errors it throws. if it had almost no error, then it has =
a pretty high chance to recover the data.

You can also try other bytenr from your find-root output, but I guess =
you only need to try the first 4 bytenrs.

Thanks,
Qu
