I setup the Alpine dev environment but unfortunately I don't think I am 
getting an expected result:

alpine-devhost [~/aports/main/linux-lts/src]$ 
./linux-5.15/scripts/faddr2line build-lts.x86_64/vmlinux 
btrfs_alloc_chunk+0x570
no match for btrfs_alloc_chunk+0x570

alpine-devhost [~/aports/main/linux-lts/src]$ 
./linux-5.15/scripts/faddr2line build-lts.x86_64/vmlinux 
add_extent_mapping+0x1c6
no match for add_extent_mapping+0x1c6

alpine-devhost [~/aports/main/linux-lts/src]$ 
./linux-5.15/scripts/faddr2line build-lts.x86_64/fs/btrfs/btrfs.ko 
add_extent_mapping+0x1c6
add_extent_mapping+0x1c6/0x2b0:
add_extent_mapping at ??:?

alpine-devhost [~/aports/main/linux-lts/src]$ 
./linux-5.15/scripts/faddr2line build-lts.x86_64/fs/btrfs/btrfs.ko 
btrfs_alloc_chunk+0x570
btrfs_alloc_chunk+0x570/0x9a0:
btrfs_alloc_chunk at ??:?

(I did also run on the hosts actual unzipped /boot/vmmlinuz-lts and 
btrfs.ko.gz)

Thanks.
