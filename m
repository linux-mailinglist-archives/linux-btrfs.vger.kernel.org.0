If it's a lot of trouble to handle arbitrary data, then I think you should
change _fsv_scratch_corrupt_merkle_tree() to actually take a (byte, length) pair
instead of data on stdin.  Otherwise, _fsv_scratch_corrupt_merkle_tree() would
claim to do one thing but actually would do a different thing on one specific
filesystem.
