So you remove the explanation about FLUSH_DELAYED_REFS, yet it's
retained as a distinct state in data flush. So perhaps it should also be
removed from data_flush_state, given that transaction commit, by
definition, runs delayed refs so we don't need it as a discrete step
during data flush ? If I'm wrong then this state requires an updated
rationale.
