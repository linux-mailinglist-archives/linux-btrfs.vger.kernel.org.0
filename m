Is there a reason why you are not considering Btrfs RAID1? It provides 
redundancy and checksums to protect against bit errors on either mirror. 
Remember that Btrfs RAID1 does not work the same way as mdadm's 
alternative.

RAID0 provides no fault tolerance at all. Is there any added performance 
you need from RAID0 in your application?
