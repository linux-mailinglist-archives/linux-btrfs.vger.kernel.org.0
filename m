From: Omar Sandoval <osandov@osandov.com>

btrfs stores its data structures, including filenames in directories, in
its own buffer implementation, struct extent_buffer, composed of
several non-contiguous pages. We could copy filenames into a
temporary buffer and use fscrypt_match_name() against that buffer, such
extensive memcpying would be expensive. Instead, exposing
fscrypt_nokey_name as in this change allows btrfs to recapitulate
fscrypt_match_name() using methods on struct extent_buffer instead of
dealing with a raw byte array.
