I'm going to fix this in a different way internally in btrfs.  There's only once
place where we can't drop the lock, so I plan to just collate free'd EM's and
free them in bulk after we drop the lock.  This *may* not fix the problem, I
have to wait for lockdep to tell me I'm stupid and I missed some other
dependency, but if that's the case I'll just async free our EM's, that way I can
synchronize dropping the objects at inode drop time to avoid unpleasant timing
issues.

I think Sweet Tea was leaving this as a followup exercise, but I'd rather have
everything working out of the box, and since my patchset was a lot simpler I
figured I'd give you more opportunities to yell at me for something.

I missed this bit of feedback, I like it a lot actually because if we do decide
later to tackle key changing it would be nice if existing file systems had
everything they needed.  I think I'll still keep the slimmed down extent context
and just throw the master key in there and the encrytion type, and then do as
you say and validate it matches the inode.

Scrub just needs to read the raw bytes and validate the checksums.  This is my
other motivation for doing the checksum thing now, I want to make sure things
like scrub work out of the box since that's one of the "tricky" parts when it
comes to having data it can't actually derypt.

The key identifier is mostly around being able to simply support different keys
in the same inode, primarly for re-keying.  There is some talk of people wanting
to have differently encrypted subvolumes and reflink between them, and having
this information per-extent would make that a lot easier.  For now I've told
those people to kick rocks, but it'll be nice to be setup to add this support
later on.

Yup the cache entry gets loaded from the extent itself, so we'll have duplicate
cache entries since they're tied to the inode.  It's the same for our extent
maps as well, since you could at any point overwrite part of it and need to
update the in-memory mapping.

Thanks for the quick feedback, I'm going to finish making the appropriate
changes to the btrfs patches, make sure everything works.  I'll clean up these
patches and make the changes you suggested, and I'll update the documentation.
It'll probably be early next week when I send again, I'll do the work for
xfstests so everything works in this v2 only world.
