IPE is just a different approach, like btrfs and ext4,
for a small subset of IMA's features: appraisal.

IMA is a fantastic solution for a whole lot of scenarios that IPE will not
cover, now or ever. In fact, in production, we use IMA (both measurement
and appraisal) and IPE side-by-side. They're not mutually exclusive.
 
IPE's approach is to really focus on the policy enforcement side, delegating
the authenticity (or even just integrity) claim to other subsystems. It does
this by enforcing an opaqueness between these integrations with other subsystems,
drawing a clear line between the mechanism of the authenticity claim,
and the enforcement of that claim against authorized values in policy. This
allows for a variable security bar based on what mechanisms are selected to
be used in the system, and what are present in the policy. For instance, the security
bar of a system using dm-verity with signed root hashes as its primary authenticity
claim, as opposed to fs-verity will have a different security bar.

This is why IPE uses the built-in signatures: they are managed by fs-verity,
and IPE does not implement its own signature format or other method of
validating either the integrity or authenticity of a data source,
explicitly, as that would be contrary to its design philosophy.

We have also noticed many use cases for the fs-verity build-in signatures. Proposals
exist to use them[1]. Package managers were updated to use them[2]. We are
successfully using them in production. Therefore we prefer to keep the existing
build-in signatures.
