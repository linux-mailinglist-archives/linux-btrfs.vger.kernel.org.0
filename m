It wasn't actually a bug until more were added - you can only (AFAICT) trigger this when you're 
converting from one unhandled flag to another, so as long as its only one its okay :)

Indeed, but only if that FS/block group already has DUP in it, which seems sensible? If I have some 
metadata that is DUP and some that is SINGLE, probably write more DUP, at least until I start 
balancing it again.

Thanks!
