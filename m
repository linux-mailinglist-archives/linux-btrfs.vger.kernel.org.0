I did not use those tools. I only have Fedora 42 installed on this computer.

Yes, that seems the most likely explanation. I switched my motherboard, 
RAM, and CPU a few weeks ago, and when building a new setup out ofÂ  the 
old components and 3 different drives (including one brand new NVME SSD) 
I noticed that each time I ran a btrfs scrub on any of those I got a 
bunch of csum errors. I initially thought that maybe the drives or 
something were faulty, but when I ran memtest it discovered very quickly 
a faulty single RAM stick. That RAM had been in my main system in a 
faulty state for months probably at least. The different computer I 
built from the old parts immediately stopped failing scrubs when I 
removed the faulty RAM stick.

So yeah, I think the corruption would have been caused by that RAM 
stick. I have now completely different RAM in my system and I've run the 
same memtest multiple times and it has not found any problem, so I think 
I have now fully good RAM and won't have the same corruption issue again.

One potentially relevant detail is that I replaced one of my disks just 
before I discovered the corruption with a bigger hard drive (at this 
point I had already swapped my RAM so there shouldn't be memory 
corruption problems during the replace). I started a btrfs replace 
operation, but I had a scrub running which was then canceled. That 
cancel for some reason also canceled the replace operation. When I 
noticed that I then restarted the replace and then let it run to 
completion (though I think the replace got canceled twice as I didn't 
realize after the first one what canceled it, so I needed to restart the 
replace multiple times). After completing the replace command without an 
error message I shut down my computer and removed the replaced drive. 
Upon booting my filesystem could not mount without the degraded flag. 
Somehow the replace had copied the right amount of data to the new 
drive, but for some reason the old drive was still marked as used. I had 
to then do a btrfs remove on that device which took a really long time 
but eventually succeeded as it seemingly had to rebuild the missing 
drive from raid data (even though all of the necessary data should have 
been copied already). So it seems like the btrfs replace operation 
doesn't fully work correctly if it is interrupted.

That could be a relevant detail, but as my filesystem only had one 
corrupt folder I somewhat doubt that as I would expect a lot more things 
to have gone wrong if the replace messed up the data. So to me that 
seems only like a minor bug in the replace operation, but one that did 
not cause this corruption.

Yes, my RAM should be totally fine now.

Thanks, I will try running that repair tonight, and hoping everything is 
then fine.
