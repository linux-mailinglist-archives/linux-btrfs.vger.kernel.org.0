Hi Filipe,

Oh, sorry for this duplicated review, I tried to scan the email list to
make sure I didn't miss something.

> 
> It's trivial to do those changes.

> you amend the patch?

I expect to get a simple response from the author, for his patch.
E.g.:
1) "Yes, agree, could you help to change that when you merge it?"
2) "No, I think it doesn't make sense"
3) "Sure, I'll make a bit change in next version"
4) "Oh, that reminds me, I should cleanup more, I think I can change more about that"
...

Is that hard?

If the author doesn't have any opinions, just asks for the amending from me,
I'll do that if there's not risk. Or I suppose the author always hope to change
his code by himself, maybe not follow the review points 100%.

> for trivial changes?

You think it's trivial, due to you think you don't need more changes about
that. But I'm not sure before you say that. You can check the list, I say
"I'll help to change that when I merge it", but just when I'm sure it's clear
enough. You shouldn't use your measure to think my standard.

I didn't say I'll amend that means my review point is a reference, to check
if you have more ideas.
We just got a big regression in a _cleanup function which does:
  cd /
  rm -r -f $tmp.*
  specific_xxxx_cleanup

Then that specific_xxxx_cleanup() remove all things in "/".

If it's
  specific_xxxx_cleanup
  cd /
  rm -r -f $tmp.*

things might be different or not.

I'm not saying that change must makes differences. But the cleanup things
(e.g. theorder of the steps) might worth a bit evaluating, not just changed
by myself without any response. And a reply from the author to the review
points of his patch is not hard. Even just say "yes, please help that",
that means you reviewed and agreed my review points at least.

I'm not anyone else. Each one has his distinctive style. I don't know what's
wrong with that way to deal with patches, to make you such unsatisfied. It is
difficult to cater to all tastes.

Thanks,
Zorro
