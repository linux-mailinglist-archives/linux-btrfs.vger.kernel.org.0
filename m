                                            $10Million, ATM Master card Payment
Attention Beneficiary


I am Mr Yakubu Nelson , ATM Head of Operation Department United Bank
for Africa PLC, I resumed to this office on the 5th of last Month and
during my official research last week I discovered an abandoned ATM
Master card valued sum of $10Million with card number 5321452123409380
with  your name as the rightful beneficiary.
I tried to know why this card have not been released to you but I was
told that the formal ATM head of operation who left this office two
months ago with-held your card for his own selfish interest.
Now that your ATM Master card is still available for you to pick it up
here in our bank, I want to know how you wish to receive your ATM card
along with your four digits pin code number.
You can come down here in our bank to pick up your card direct from my
office or alternatively it can be send to your address through any
registered reliable courier service company that you will take care of
the courier charge, I don't know the cost of shipping the card to you
but if you permit me I will go to the courier shipment company to find
out the cost,
Your direct telephone number and address will be needed and more
details of your ATM card payment will be made known to you as soon as
I receive your swift positive response, to enable you know the amount
programmed for your ATM daily withdrawal. Do call me as soon as you
receive this message Tel: +226 58890037 also reply to my email:
onlineubabank1@gmail.com
Thanks For your anticipated co-operation and understanding. We will serve
You better.




Yours Faithfully,
