Depends on the bug and the microkernel.  Microkernels are not immune to
corruption bugs, though some specific paths leading to corruption are
blocked.  e.g. instead of memcpy() with a bad pointer, it's a device
driver process calculating the wrong physical address for a DMA write.

Also, regardless of kernel implementation, the hibernation procedure
is extremely _invasive_.  It necessarily transports every process and
significant chunks of kernel state to disk and back to memory, and has
opportunities to corrupt data in transit or at rest.

The environment might be different for a stand-alone memory tester
compared to one that can run on Linux alongside a production workload.
e.g. if a bus component is failing due to heat stress, that failure might
not be triggered in the standalone case where the failing bus componenet
is inactive, but will be triggered under a full system load where the
failing component is active.  Similarly bugs in the Linux kernel itself,
or interactions between kernel and firmware, will not be visible with
a standalone test.

On the other hand, if the problem _is_ a RAM component failure, a
standalone test will verify it's that and nothing else.
