I believe it is still being used, unless I messed up the patch I sent in
the end. Taking a quick look, I think it's set at fs/btrfs/verity.c:558.

btrfs_set_fs_compat_ro(root->fs_info, VERITY);

I believe I still needed it because the tree checker doesn't scan every
inode on the filesystem when you mount, so it would only freak out about
a ro-compat inode later on if the inode didn't happen to be in a leaf
that was being checked at mount time.

Hmm. I didn't update fsck, but now that you mention it, I think I need to...
I'll test it right away and get back to you, but I suspect I need to
hurry up and implement it.
