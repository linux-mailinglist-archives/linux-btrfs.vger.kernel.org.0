That would work, if you're good with that. It felt like a larger 
deviation, with the possibility of unbounded continued use of a 
soft-removed master key; should fscrypt restrict use of the master key 
only to extents that are part of inodes that are already open?

So you're proposing just storing a nonce per extent, then setting up a 
prepared key only, taking the inode's master key and doing the hkdf 
expand with the nonce into the prepared key? A terse approach, a lot 
closer to the original design than I thought.

I think I referenced it in the updated design (fifth paragraph of 
"Extent encryption" 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1janjxewlewtVPqctkWOjSa7OhCgB8Gdx7iDaCDQQNZA/edit?usp=sharing) 
but I didn't talk about it enough -- 'rekeying' is a substitute for 
adding a policy to a directory full of unencrypted data. Ya'll's points 
about the badness of having mixed unencrypted and encrypted data in a 
single dir were compelling. (As I recall it, the issue with having mixed 
enc/unenc data is that a bug or attacker could point an encrypted file 
autostarted in a container, say /container/my-service, at a unencrypted 
extent under their control, say /bin/bash, and thereby acquire a backdoor.)

I'd planned to use add_enckey to add all the necessary keys, 
set_encpolicy on an encrypted directory under the proper conditions 
(flags interpreted by ioctl? check if filesystem has hook?) recursively 
calls a filesystem-provided hook on each inode within to change the 
fscrypt_context. Either dir items could be reencrypted with the new key 
or dirs could keep around the oldest key for encryption and the newest 
key for new leaf inodes to inherit.

For leaf inodes, 2 options for the remaining questions:

1) leaf inodes just stores the policy to be used for writing new data or 
inherits it from a parent directory. If you're reading and you hit an 
extent whose key isn't loaded, you get an IO error. If you're writing 
and you try to write to an inode who needs a key that isn't loaded, you 
get an IO error eventually.

This is what I'd prefer: Josef and Chris and I discussed this a while 
back and thought this was acceptable semantics for our uses, I think, 
and it's simple; you can already get an IO error if you're reading a 
file and suddenly hit an invalid extent, or if you are writing a file 
and run out of space.

2) all inodes store a fscrypt_context for all policies configured for 
the inode. ->get_context() gets a index parameter to get the index'th 
context. directory inodes' info is loaded off the one needed for dir 
entry encryption, leaf inodes' off the newest context. When any inode is 
opened, all the contexts are read and checked that their key is loaded, 
and then discarded, except the one in use for writes to that inode.

If a key is removed, you get an IO error when you do IO that needs that 
key, with the usual async conditions. Or, some lightweight structure is 
added to each master key's open inode list to point at the inode using 
it, and the inode keeps the master key around while it's open, thereby 
preventing IO errors after open.

Here's a shot at elaboration of usecase more:

On various machines, we currently have a btrfs filesystem containing 
various volumes/snapshots containing starting states for containers. The 
snapshots are generated by common snapshot images built centrally. The 
machines, as the scheduler requests, start and stop containers on those 
volumes.

We want to be able to start a container on a snapshot/volume such that 
every write to the relevant snapshot/volume is using a per-container 
key, but we don't care about reads of the starting snapshot image being 
encrypted since the starting snapshot image is widely shared. When the 
container is stopped, no future different container (or human or host 
program) knows its key. This limits the data which could be lost to a 
malicious service/human on the host to only the volumes containing 
currently running containers.

Some other folks envision having a base image encrypted with some 
per-vendor key. Then the machine is rekeyed with a per-machine key in 
perhaps the TPM to use for updates and logfiles. When a user is created, 
a snapshot of a base homedir forms the base of their user 
subvolume/directory, which is then rekeyed with a per-user key. When the 
user logs in, systemd-homedir or the like could load their per-user key 
for their user subvolume/directory.

Since we don't care about encrypting the common image, we initially 
envisioned unencrypted snapshot images where we then turn on encryption 
and have mixed unenc/enc data. The other usecase, though, really needs 
key change so that everything's encrypted. And the argument that mixed 
unenc/enc data is not safe was compelling.

Hope that helps?
