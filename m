SO what was the last workload that got run on this server. The
btrfs-progs log suggests the last 2 transactions have been lost
expecting 66655 vs finding 66653. Also looking at the missing file names
it suggests you were fiddling with some windows development software? I
can see a mix of .dll.so files and also a bunch of just .dll files. SO
what was the last thing you installed on that machine? Are you using
dual boot by any chance on the same disk?
