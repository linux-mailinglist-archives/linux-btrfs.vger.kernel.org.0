Hi David and Anand, I've manage to test misc-next of today, that
includes both this patchset as well as the "support cloned-device mount
capabilityâ€‹" one.

It seems to be working fine for our use case, though I'll test a bit
more on Deck. I was able to mount the same filesystem (spread in 2 nvme
devices) at the same time, in any order...the second one always get the
temp-fsid. Tested also re-mounting the devices on other locations, and
it seems all consistent, with no error observed.

I also question the value of the incompat flag, not seeing much use for
that..looping Qu Wenruo as they first suggested this flag-based
approach, in case there is some more feedback...

Anyway, thanks for your improved approach Anand and to David: is it
expected to land on 6.7?
Cheers,


Guilherme
