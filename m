I thought more about writing a lot of little files as I expect that to 
use more metadata, butâ€¦ I can just work around it by using command line 
tools instead of Dolphin to move data around. This is mostly my music, 
photos and so on filesystem, I do not change data on it very often, so 
that will most likely work just fine for me until there is a proper fix.

So do need to do any more things that could potentially age the 
filesystem. :)
