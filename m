The reason that an error is expected for corruption past EOF in the block
containing EOF, is to ensure that the bad data isn't visible via mmap reads.  If
that's not a problem for btrfs due to it always zeroing the part past EOF, I
think it would be fine to change that test case (specifically the one with
parameters "corruption_test 130999 131000 72") to just try a mmap read of the
whole EOF block, and check that it either fails with an error *or* returns
zeroes.  I don't think that an entirely new test script would be warranted.
