For the record, we had a chat about that and found that explicit build
checks won't be necessary as the old/new structure has no overlap of the
members so the build would fail anyway.

I did the rename from btrfs_logical_bio* to btrfs_bio again in
misc-next, please have a look, it's basically what Qu sent as v2.
