Dear friend,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as a big surprise. Actually, I came
across your E-mail from my personal search afterward I decided to
email you directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my
final wish before or after my death.

Meanwhile, I am Madam Elizabeth Edwards, 63 years, from USA, childless
and I am suffering from Adenocarcinoma Cancer of the lung for the past
8 years and from all indication my condition is really deteriorating
as my doctors have confirmed and courageously advised me that I may
not live beyond two months from now for the reason that my tumor has
reached a critical stage which has defiled all forms of medical
treatment.


Since my days are numbered, I've decided willingly to fulfill my
long-time vow to donate you the sum ($8.5 000.000.00) million dollars
I inherited from my late husband Mr. Edward Herbart, foreign bank
account over years.

If you will be honest, kind and willing to assist in transfer of this
money to his or her account and use the funds for charity work of God
while you use 50% for yourself. I want you to know there are no risks
involved, it is 100% hitch free & safe. If you would be interested to
assist in getting this fund into your account for a charity project to
fulfill my promise before I die please let me know immediately. I will
appreciate your utmost confidentiality as I wait for your reply.

Kindly get back to me at my discreet Email (
mrselizabethedward2@gmail.com ) for further discussion.

Best Regards
Mrs. Elizabeth Edward
