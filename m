I take that what you say is true, but what I said is that when a user  
(or application) makes a
normal copy from one subvolume to another, then it won't be a  
reflink-copy. To make such a reflink-copy, you need btrfs-aware cp or  
btrfs-aware applications.

So, the reflik-copy is a special case, usually explicitly requested by  
the user.

OK, but that cannot be helped: either you retain the sharing structure  
with imperfect defrag, or you unshare and produce a perfect defrag  
which should have somewhat better performance (and pray that the disk  
doesn't fill up).

Not necesarily. Because you can defrag in the time-of-day when there  
is a low pressure on the disk IO, so updating 20000 references is  
esentially free.

You are just making those later 100 reads faster.

OK, you are right, there is some limit, but this is such a rare case,  
that such a heavily-referenced extents are best left untouched.
I suggest something along these lines: if there are more than XX  
(where XX defaults to 1000) reflinks to an extent, then one or more  
copies of the extent should be made such that each has less than XX  
reflinks to it. The number XX should be user-configurable.

So, just make the number XX user-provided.

OK. If you don't touch those extents, they are still shared. That's  
what I wanted.

Yes, but I think that we are going into too much details which are  
diverting the attention from the overall picture and from big problems.

And the big problem here is: what do we want defrag to do in general,  
most common cases. Because we haven't still agreed on that one since  
many of the people here are ardent followers of the  
defrag-by-unsharing ideology.

I really don't have a clue what's happening, but if I were to start  
working on it (which I won't), then the first things should be:
- creating a way for btrfs to split large extents into smaller ones  
(for easier defrag, as first phase).
- creating a way for btrfs to merge small adjanced extents shared by  
the same files into larger extents (as the last phase of defragmenting  
a file).
- create a structure (associative array) for defrag that can track  
backlinks. Keep the structure updated with each filesystem change, by  
placing hooks in filesystem-update routines.

You can't go wrong with this. Whatever details change about defrag  
operation, the given three things will be needed by defrag.

OK, but then, you agree with me that current defrag is a joke. I mean,  
something is better than nothing, and the current defrag isn't  
completely useless, but it is in most circumstances either unusable or  
not good enough.

I mean, the snapshots are a prime feature of btrfs. If not, then why  
bother with b-trees? If you wanted subvolumes, checksums and RAID,  
then you should have made ext5. B-trees are in btrfs so that there can  
be snapshots. But, the current defrag works bad with snaphots. It  
doesn't defrag them well, it also unshares data. Bad bad bad.

And if you wanted to be honest to your users, why don't you place this  
info in the wiki? Ok, the wiki says "defrag will unshare", but it  
doesn't say that it also doesn't defragment well.

For example, lets examine the typical home user. If he is using btrfs,  
it means he probably wants snapshots of his data. And, after a few  
snapshots, his data is fragmented, and the current defrag can't help  
because it does a terrible job in this particualr case.

So why don't you write on the wiki "the defrag is practically unusable  
in case you use snapshots". Because that is the truth. Be honest.
