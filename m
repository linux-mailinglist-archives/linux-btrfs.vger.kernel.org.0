Sorry I probably can't bring you back the fs, I just have a possibly
relevant datapoint to share:

with recent Ubuntu 20.04 and a rather convoluted storage stack (i.e. LVM
volumes consumed not by fs directly but insted by e.g. luks and/or
bcache), on shutdown systemd service blk-availability.service would lead
to 1m30s of frantic disk activity without ever finishing.

I did not have much time to investigate (and I don't right now), but I
remember coming to the conclusion that blk-availability or the invoked
scripts do not honor the case where an LVM volume is consumed by
anything else than a plain filesystem, and so they loop endlessly until
finally being killed by systemd.

I haven't lost data AFAICT, but it's a nuisance, and I disable
blk-availability whenever I see it, and I don't even fully understand
what it intends to achieve.

It is possible that in your case the same type of frantic disk activity
kept some vital fs information from actually reaching the disk.

Regards
Matthias
