This convention is somewhat confusing. This function returns a boolean
meaniing if a device matched or not, yet the retval follows strcmp
convention of return values. That is make 1 mean "device matched" and
"0" mean device not matched. Because ultimately that's what we care for.

Furthermore you give it the ability to return an error which not
consumed at all. Simply make the function boolean and return false if an
error is encountered by some of the internal calls.

Instead of allocating memory for storing device->name and freeing it,
AFAICS lookup_bdev can be called under rcu read section so you can
simply call lookup_bdev under rcu_read_lock which simplifies memory
management.


In the end this function really boils down to making 2 calls to
lookup_bdev and comparing their values for equality, no need for
anything more fancy than that.

What's more lookinng at the body of free_stale_device I find the name of
the function somewhat confusing. What it does is really delete all
devices from all fs_devices which match a particular criterion for a
device path i.e the function's body doesn't deal with the concept of
"stale" at all. As such I think it should be renamed and given a more
generic name like btrfs_free_specific_device or something along those
lines.
