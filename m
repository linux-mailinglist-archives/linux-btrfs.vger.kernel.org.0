I probably didn't understand it correctly. I think there were three 
points in it:

1) reconsider per-extent keys
2) make IV generation work for non-directkey policies as similarly as 
possible to how they work in inode-based filesystems
3) never use 'file-based' except in contrast to dm-crypt and other 
block-layer encryption.

For point 2, I changed the initial extent context generation to match up 
with fscrypt_generate_iv() (and probably didn't call that out enough in 
the description). (Looking at it again, I could literally call 
fscrypt_generate_iv() to generate the initial extent context; I didn't 
realize that before).

Then adding lblk_num to the existing lblk_num in the iv from the start 
of the extent should be the same as the iv->lblk_num setting in the 
inode-based case: for lblk 12, for instance, the same IV should result 
from inode-based with lblk 12, as with extent-based with an initial 
lblk_num of 9 and an extent_offset of 3. For shared extents, they'll be 
different, but for singly-referenced extents, the IVs should be exactly 
the same in theory.

I'm not sure whether I misunderstood the points or didn't address them 
fully, I apologize. Would you be up for elaborating where I missed, 
either by email or by videochat whenever works for you?

Thanks.
