Sure.  Just a couple notes:

First, fs/verity/ does still need to be able to tell whether the buffer is newly
instantiated or not.

Second, fs/verity/ uses the ahash API to do the hashing.  ahash is a
scatterlist-based API.  Virtual addresses can still be used (see sg_set_buf()),
but the memory cannot be vmalloc'ed memory, since virt_to_page() needs to work.
Does XFS use vmalloc'ed memory for these buffers?

BTW, converting fs/verity/ from ahash to shash is an option; I've really never
been a fan of the scatterlist-based crypto APIs!  The disadvantage of doing
this, though, would be that it would remove support for all the hardware crypto
drivers.  That *might* actually be okay, as that approach to crypto acceleration
has mostly fallen out of favor, in favor of CPU-based acceleration.  But I do
worry about e.g. someone coming out of the woodwork and saying they need to use
fsverity on a low-powered ARM board that has a crypto accelerator like CAAM, and
they MUST use their crypto accelerator to get acceptable performance.
