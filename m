I've recommended, and continue to recommend, leaving out that feature from the
patchset for now too.  The question is how does the plan to implement this
feature impact the initial patchset, i.e. the basic support for btrfs
encryption.  Should we choose a "heavyweight extents" design (a full
fscrypt_context per extent: nonce, encryption modes, and key) now in preparation
for that feature, or should we choose a "lightweight extents" design (just a
nonce per extent, with modes and key coming from one of the extent's inodes
which would all be enforced to have the same values of those).  The lightweight
extents design wouldn't be compatible with the "change the encryption key"
feature, but I expect it would be simpler.  Maybe there are issues that I
haven't thought of, but that is what I expect.

So before going with a design that is potentially more complex, and won't be
able to be changed later as it will define the on-disk format, I'm hoping to see
a little more confirmation of "yes, this is really needed".  That could mean
getting the design, or even better the implementation, ready for the "change the
encryption key" feature.  Or, maybe you need "heavyweight extents" anyway
because you want/need btrfs extents to be completely self-describing and don't
want to have to pull any information from an inode -- maybe for technical
reasons, maybe for philosophical reasons.  I don't know.  It's up to you guys to
provide the rationale for the design you've chosen.

BTW, one of the reasons for my concern is that the original plan for ext4
encryption, which became fscrypt, was extremely ambitious and resulted in a
complex design.  But only the first phase actually ended up getting implemented,
and as a result the design was simplified greatly just before ext4 encryption
was upstreamed.  I worry about something similar happening, but missing the
"simplify the design" part and ending up with unnecessary complexity.

I think a big challenge which is being glossed over is how do you actually set a
new encryption policy for an entire directory tree, which can contain thousands
(or even millions!) of files.  Do you actually go through and update something
on every file, and if so who does it: userspace or kernel?  Or will there be a
layer of indirection that allows the operation to be done in a fixed amount of
work?  Maybe each inode has an encryption policy ID which points into a btree of
encryption policies, and you update that btree to change what the ID refers to?
But that doesn't work if you're changing the encryption policy of only a subset
of files that use a given encryption policy, or if the files are unencrypted.

What happens for directories?  Can their policy change?  I think it can't; all
filenames will have to be encrypted with the original policy.  Is that okay?

What about regular files?  I assume their policy would get replaced, not
appended to, since with extent-based encryption the only purpose of a regular
file's policy is to have it be inherited by new extents of that file?

The number one thing I'm asking for is something that's maintainable and as easy
to understand as possible.  I don't think we've quite reached that yet.
