Hey.

Right now it seems, btrfs doesn't automatically set -o discard,
depending on whether or no a SSD is detected.

The FAQ entry https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/FAQ#Does_Btrfs_support_TRIM.2Fdiscard.3F
seems to imply that this was done because of several reasons:


- dm-crypt security issues
  => that should be a non-issue, because AFAIU, dm-crypt itself simply
     blocks any TRIM/discard, unless cryptsetupâ€™s --allow-discards is
     specifically set when opening the device

- disputed performance benefits
  => Is this still questioned?
     I don't have any concrete benchmarks, but I mean using TRIM is
     what probably every SSD manufacturer suggests?


Another disadvantage of not auto-detecting this is that - with default
mount options (i.e. no discard) - VMs and the like, wont give back any
space in their storage images.


Cheers,
Chris
