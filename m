Yup, I meant what I said.

Someone sets up a rPi5 as a NAS, formats the disk from it, as you would
normally when setting up such a thing from scratch. Later, the rPi stops
working, as rPis often do. This person's data is now *completely
inaccessible* until they find another Raspberry Pi 5 or an Apple Silicon
laptop.

This is going to be *common*. And since the 16K decision is made at
format time, these people are going to be oblivious until they find
themselves with an urgent need to acquire a Raspberry Pi 5 to access
their data at all, and then they're going to be mad. So the longer you
wait to flip the switch, the more people unaware of their own data's
fragile accessibility condition you will build up, and the more upset
people you're going to have even long after the change was finally made.
