Hi Zygo.

Thank you for your hints.

My bet is also that the drive is fine.

Yeah. I avoid hibernation for now.

Or I think I did not word it clearly enough. I said "crash" but thought 
about a longer term failure scenario as you outlined below:

That is exactly what I think might have happened.

So I think there is not much of a point to keep my "homedefect" logical 
volume around. No developer asked me to do anything to obtain further 
information on the issue. If it stays like that for say another week, I 
will return the 300G for the "homedefect" LV to the wear leveling pool 
of the SSD.

I think it could matter in case of a software bug, i.e. another kernel 
component accidentally writing into memory BTRFS uses. This would be 
prevented by a micro kernel.

I may still do this. However I already run the UEFI Lenovo Diagnostic 
tool and had it do a memory test. It appears to be fine. I did the quick 
test but then also ran a good part, but not all of a several hour long 
test. No issues.

Yeap, that is what I am using at the moment. It does not seem to corrupt 
memory. So without hibernation and without the USB-C dock which 
triggered all kinds of issues with network driver for that r8152 card in 
there and all kind of other strange issues, the laptop appears to finally 
be stable. Seems for AMD based Gen 1 ThinkPads, I bet Gen 2 as well 
there is still some R&D needed to get them stable in these situations as 
well.

Best,
