I'm taking a look at this, but I don't think it's really reviewable in its
current state.  The main problem is how the new functionality is reusing struct
fscrypt_info.  Before an fscrypt_info was the information (key, policy, inode
back-pointer, master key link, etc.) associated with an inode.  But now it can
be any of the following:

- Information for an inode
- Cached policy (?) for a "leaf inode"
- Information for an extent

Everything just seems kind of mixed together.  It's not clear which fields of
fscrypt_info apply to which scenario, and which scenario(s) is being handled
when code works with fscrypt_info.  There seem to be bugs caused by these
scenarios being mixed up.  Comments are also inconsistent; a huge number of them
still refer only to "inode" or "file" when that is no longer correct.  So it's
quite hard to understand the code now.

I think there really needs to be some work on designing and documenting the data
structures for what you are trying to accomplish.  That really ought to have
been the first step before getting deep into coding the actual functionality.

Have you considered creating a new struct like fscrypt_extent_info, instead of
reusing fscrypt_info?  I think that would make things much clearer.  I suppose
there is code that needs to operate on the shared fields of both, but that could
be done by putting the shared fields in a sub-struct like 'struct
fscrypt_common_info common;', and passing around a pointer to that where needed.

I'd also like to reiterate the concern I raised last month
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20230703045417.GA3057@sol.localdomain/):
a lot of this complexity seems to have been contributed to by the "heavyweight
extents" design choice.  I was hoping to see a detailed design for the "change a
directory's tree encryption policy" feature you are planning to use this for, in
order to get some confidence that it will actually be implemented.  Otherwise, I
fear we'll end up building in a lot of complexity for something that never gets
implemented.
