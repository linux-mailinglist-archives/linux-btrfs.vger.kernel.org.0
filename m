Perhaps this structure needs to be turned into a btrfs_bio.

It's not even that, because btrfs_bio itself is not submitted at all,
it's really some sort of a semaphore, which is used to signal all stripe
bios i.e those bios which are submitted to the actual devices have
completed. In that regard it's not even a bio per-se, more like an
io_context.

This should be compressed_io_ctx or some such.
