__GFP_NOFAIL for memcg charging is reasonable in many scenarios. Memcg
oom-killer is enabled for __GFP_NOFAIL and going over limit and getting
oom-killed is totally reasonable. Orthogonal to the discussion though.

To me this metadata is overhead, so yes checksum is something not the
actual data stored on the storage.

Sorry I am not very familiar with btrfs. What is tree block?

Can you point me to ext4/xfs code where they are allocating uncharged
memory for their metadata?

This amount of uncharged memory is concerning which becomes part of
system overhead and may impact the schedulable memory for the datacenter
environment.

Overall the code seems fine and no pushback from me if btrfs maintainers
are ok with this. I think btrfs should move to slab+shrinker based
solution for this metadata unless there is deep technical reason not to.
