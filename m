I don't think that's a good way to do it.  The fscrypt settings are supposed to
be very concrete, meaning that they specify a particular way of doing the
encryption, which can be reviewed for its security and which can be tested for
correctness of the on-disk format.  There shouldn't be cryptographic differences
between how different filesystems implement the same setting.

The fscrypt settings also shouldn't specify internal implementation details of
the code, as "IV_FROM_FS" does.  From userspace's perspective, *all* fscrypt
settings have IVs chosen by the filesystem; the division between the
"filesystem" and fs/crypto/ is an internal kernel implementation detail.

So I think you should go with something like RANDOM_IV or IV_PER_EXTENT.

This is inconsistent with your commit message, which says that there is a random
IV for each block of data.  It's also inconsistent with your proposed change to
fscrypt_limit_io_blocks().  So I don't know which to believe.

Clearly this can't be properly reviewed on its own, so please send out the whole
patch series and not just the fs/crypto/ parts.
