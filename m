Could you give the 4 top patches, i.e. those above
8c92606ab810 ("sched/cpuacct: Make user/system times in cpuacct.stat more precise")
a try?

https://git.gitlab.arm.com/linux-arm/linux-vs.git -b mainline/sched/nohz-next-update-regression

I gave that a quick test on the platform that caused me to write the patch
you bisected and looks like it didn't break the original fix. If the above
counter-measures aren't sufficient, I'll have to go poke at your
reproducers...
