There is a fairly obvious problem here.   A malicious attacker could
"trick" the filesystem into endlessly decompressing the same blocks,
which because the compressed data is cached, could cause it to use
all CPU, and cause a DOS attack.  Caching the uncompressed data prevents
these decompression attacks from occurring so easily.
