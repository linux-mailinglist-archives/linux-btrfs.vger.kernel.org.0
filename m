No dice. Even after another full re-balance, the problem is back, and even 
worse. Now with 6.2.10-200.fc37.x86_64:

$ sudo iotop-c -o
Total DISK READ:    0.00 B/s
Total DISK WRITE:  10.18 K/s
Current DISK READ:  0.00 B/s
Current DISK WRITE: 0.00 B/s
TID PRIO USER DISK READ DISK WRITE SWAPIN IO GRAPH[IO]â–½ COMMAN
 784 be/4 root 0.00 B/s 0.00 B/s 0.00% 96.05% btrfs-transaction

For some reason btrfs-transaction keeps the disk busy at almost 100%, with 
no real disk I/O going on, system load goes up to ~140. A few (maybe 10 
minutes later) the system recovers and sync(1) comes back too.

Any ideas on how to debug this?

Thanks,
Christian.
