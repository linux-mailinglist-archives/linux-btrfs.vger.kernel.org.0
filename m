This patch is not necessary.  The rules for accessing ->i_crypt_info are
actually pretty simple: when it's unknown whether ->i_crypt_info has been set,
then it's necessary to use fscrypt_get_info() and check whether the resulting
pointer is NULL or not (or use fscrypt_has_encryption_key() which does both).
That's because another thread could set it concurrently.

In contrast, when it *is* known that ->i_crypt_info has been set, then that can
only be because fscrypt_has_encryption_key() was already executed on the same
thread, or because an operation that ensured the key is set up already happened.
For example, when doing I/O to a file, it's guaranteed that the file has been
opened.  In either case, direct access is fine.
