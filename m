You could certainly add such a function that wraps around verify_data_block().
The minimal function prototype needed (without supporting readahead or reusing
the ahash_request) would be something like the following, I think:

    bool fsverity_verify_blocks_dio(struct inode *inode, u64 pos,
                                    struct folio *folio,
                                    size_t len, size_t offset);

And I really hope that you don't want to do DIO to the *Merkle tree*, as that
would make the problem significantly harder.  I think DIO for the data, but
handling the Merkle tree in the usual way, would be okay?

I believe it would be possible, especially if DIO to the Merkle tree is not in
scope.  There just hasn't been a reason to the work yet.  And ext4 and f2fs
already fall back to buffer I/O for other filesystem features, so there was
precedent for not bothering with DIO, at least in the initial version.
