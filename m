The canonical name is _destroy(). We even have mutex_destroy() except
it's usage isn't mandatory.

The easy way out is doing as lockdep does and hook into the memory
allocators and check every free'd hunk of memory for a lock. It does
hoever mean your data structure of choice needs to be able to answer: do
I have an entry in @range. Which mostly disqualifies a hash-table.

Still, I really don't think you need any of this, it's just bloat. A
very limited stack unwind for one of the two tracepoints should allow
you to find the offending lock just fine.
