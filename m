The kind of inline encryption hardware we see on Android devices tends
to have these limitations:

- as you indicate, loading keys can incur latency, so if many keys are
in use at once it can slow things down
- it's limited to using AES-XTS
- on UFS devices, the IV (transmitted in the DUN) must be zero in the
64 high bits
- consecutive blocks in the same operation use consecutive IVs
- there's no easy way to gather a checksum or MAC over the on-disk
ciphertext short of re-reading after writing

Android works around this with IV_INO_LBLK_64 policies, but these only
work well on the relatively small storage devices we use on Android.
In particular the IV limitation is very serious:

- inode numbers must be four bytes
- they must never change (so ext4 filesystem resizing is disabled)
- files cannot be more than 2^32 blocks

Things are worse on eMMC devices.

Even without this IV limitation, the security proofs for most AES
modes of operation start to look shaky as you approach the "birthday
bound" of encrypting 2^68 bytes with the same key. If your attack
model always assumes a point-in-time attack then you only have to
worry if you use a single key to encrypt a multi-exabyte storage
device; btrfs is designed to scale to such devices and more. If your
attack model includes an attacker who repeatedly gets access to the
storage device across time, then writing multiple exabytes with the
same key can be a problem even if some of those are overwritten. This
leads us to prefer per-extent AES keys (derived from a root key) if
possible. It's a shame AES doesn't have a 256-bit blocksize.

The way btrfs works also gives us some opportunities to do things a
little better. In general disk encryption has to make sacrifices to
deal with the limitation that IVs must be reused and there's no room
for a MAC. But because btrfs writes in whole extents, with fresh
metadata and checksum on each write, it becomes possible to use a
fresh IV and MAC for every new write. This opens up the possibility of
using an AEAD mode like AES-GCM. This combination gives us the
strongest proofs of security even against very generous attack models.

Our recommendation: btrfs should first build the ideal thing first
since it will have reasonable performance for most users, then later
design alternatives that make a few compromises for performance where
there is demand.
