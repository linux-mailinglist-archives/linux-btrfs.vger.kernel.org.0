Well, in a cgroup aware writeback path we'd always be off much better
to just do the work from a cgroup specific thread instead of bouncing
it around.

I don't think it is a problem per see.  But it is: a) inefficient and
b) complex in terms of code.  So why bounce around between 2, or in case
of writeback 3 threads for a single I/O, instead of making sure your
offload threads are simplify cgroup specific to start with?
