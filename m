This is intended to be a generic interface that doesn't require any 
particular IV scheme from the filesystem. In practice, the btrfs side of 
the code is using a per-extent starting IV, as originally proposed. I 
don't see a way for the interface to require IVs per extent, but maybe 
there is a better way than this. Or, is there more detail I can add to 
the change description to clarify that the filesystem doesn't 
necessarily have to store an IV for each individual data block?

I don't know sufficiently much about authenticated encryption to have 
considered it. As currently drafted, btrfs encrypts before checksumming 
if checksums are enabled, and checks against checksums before 
decrypting. Although at present we haven't discussed authentication 
tags, btrfs could store them in a separate itemtype which could be added 
at any time, much as we currently store fsverity data. We do have 
sufficient room saved for adding other encryption types, if necessary; 
we could use some of that to indicate the existence of authentication 
tags for the extents' data.

I think you're imagining an interface similar to get/set_context, where 
the first time a block is written the filesystem's set_IV method is 
called, and subsequent encryption/decryption calls get_IV, which is 
definitely elegant in its symmetry. But I'm not sure how to have a 
per-block set_IV and also only store an IV per extent, and it would be a 
significant cost to store an IV per block.

I would be happy to add a fscrypt_get_random_iv() method, instead of 
having the filesystem call get_random_bytes() itself, if you'd like.

Thank you!
