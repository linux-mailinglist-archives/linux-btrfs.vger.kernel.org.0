I was thinking of it in terms of "RO compat is the goal" and having new
inode flags totally broke that and was treated as a corruption of the
inode regardless of the fs being ro/rw. I think a check on a live fs
would just flip the fs ro, which was the goal anyway, but a check that
happened during mount would fail the mount, even for a read-only fs. 

Making it fully per file would be pretty cool! The only thing
really missing as far as I can tell is a way to mark a file read only
with the same semantics fsverity uses from within btrfs.
