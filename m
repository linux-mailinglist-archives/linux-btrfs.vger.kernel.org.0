So thinking a bit more about the renaming we are trading "awkwardness"
for future generations so that we make backporting easier or rather more
fool proof.

What if we backport a patch that does BUILD_BUG_ON predicated on the
size of the btrfs_io_bio. That way if a patch backports cleanly and
automatically but in fact git got confused by btrfs_bio vs btrfs_io_bio
then a build failure would ensue due to mismatched sizes and that would
be a clear indication something has gone wrong so whoever is doing the
backport can go and correct the backport? David what do you think about
this?
