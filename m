So, what you are asking for is the ability to add some information to a
btrfs filesystem listing a set of possible "alternate default"
subvolumes. How any user, OS, application or boot manager might use that
information is unspecified and up to them. It would have no impact on
btrfs behaviour - just provide a useful place to store some hints for
alternative subvolumes users or applications might choose to try to
mount as the filesystem root subvolume if they want. It wouldn't
interact with the existing concept of setting a default subvolume - it
would just be hint to users that here are some other subvolumes they
might want to try mounting.

rEFInd could, if it wished, look that list of alternates and create
choices for trying to boot using each of those subvolumes as the mount
point. What happens then would depend on what the user had put in those
subvolumes.
