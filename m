The system array is the array which holds the chunk maps i.e it's the
first thing which needs to be read from the super block (housed at
offset 64k in the device). So the error basically tells you that this
cannot be read and return -ENOENT. If the system chunk array is broken
then you can't really do anything with the filesystem. But given your
other explanation - that the system doesn't really have corrupted trees
(as visible from btrfs check output) then this is indeed caused by some
timing issues with the hard drives not being able to be brought up.
