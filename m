Hi,

Thanks for starting this discussion, it's an interesting topic.

At MSFT we use fsverity in production, with signatures enforced by the
kernel (and policy enforced by the IPE LSM). It's just too easy to fool
userspace with well-timed swaps and who knows what else. This is not
any different from dm-verity from our POV, it complements it. I very
much want the kernel to be in charge of verification and validation, at
the time of use.

In essence, I very strongly object to marking this as deprecated. It is
entirely ok if at Google you want to move everything out of the kernel,
you know your use case best so if that works better for you that's
absolutely fine (and thus your other patch looks good to me), but I
don't think it should be deprecated for everybody else too.
