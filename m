There isn't really an easy way to test for the presence of this feature.
The closest I could think of is modify btrfs' exclusive_operation sysfs
to show "balance paused" and in the test simply run a dummy balance and
pause it and check whether "balance" or "balance paused" is the state of
the exclusive op. However this means for this test to also rely on the
presence of the exclusive_operation sysfs file. However, I don't like
this because adding a device to balance is independent of the
exclusive_operation sysfs i.e it only has an informative role.
