Right, if extent keys are derived directly from the master key, and
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY is executed which causes the master key secret to
be wiped, then no more extent keys can be derived.

So I see why you implemented the behavior you did.  It does seem a bit
dangerous, though.  If I understand correctly, under your proposal, if
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY is executed while a process is doing buffered
writes to an encrypted file protected by that key, then past writes will get
synced out just before the key removal, but future writes will just be silently
thrown away.  (Remember, writes in Linux are asynchronous; processes don't get
informed of write errors unless they call fsync() or are doing direct I/O.)

I wonder if we should just keep the master key around, for per-extent key
derivation only, until all files using that master key have been closed.  That
would minimize the changes from the current fscrypt semantics.

Your original design didn't use per-extent keys, but rather had a single
contents encryption key per master key.  We had discussed that that approach had
multiple disadvantages, one of which is that on btrfs it can run uncomfortably
close to the cryptographic limits for the contents encryption modes such as
AES-XTS.  So we decided to go with per-extent keys instead.

I don't think we discussed cryptographic limits on the master key itself.  That
is actually much less of a concern, as the master key is just used for
HKDF-SHA512.  I don't think there is any real need to ever change the master
key.  (Well, if it is compromised, it could be needed, but that's not really
relevant here.  If that happens you'd need to re-encrypt everything anyway.)

I do recall some discussion of making it possible to set an encryption policy on
an *unencrypted* directory, causing new files in that directory to be encrypted.
However, I don't recall any discussion of making it possible to add another
encryption policy to an *already-encrypted* directory.  I think this is the
first time this has been brought up.

I think that allowing directories to have multiple encryption policies would
bring in a lot of complexity.  How would it be configured, and what would the
semantics for accessing it be?  Where would the encryption policies be stored?
What if you have added some of the keys but not all of them?  What if some of
the keys get removed but not all of them?

Can you elaborate more on why you want this?  I was already a bit concerned
about the plan for making it possible to set an encryption policy on an
unencrypted directory, as that already diverges from the existing fscrypt
semantics.  But now it sounds like the scope has grown even more.

Keep in mind that in general, the closer we are able to stick to the existing
fscrypt semantics and design, the easier it is going to be to get the initial
btrfs fscrypt support merged.  Planning ahead for new features is good, but we
should also be careful not to overdesign.
