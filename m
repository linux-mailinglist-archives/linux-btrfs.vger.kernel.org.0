FWIW, dm-verity went in the other direction.  It started with shash, and then in
2017 it was switched to ahash by https://git.kernel.org/linus/d1ac3ff008fb9a48
("dm verity: switch to using asynchronous hash crypto API").

I think that was part of my motivation for using ahash in fsverity from the
beginning.

Still, it does seem that ahash is more trouble than it's worth these days...
