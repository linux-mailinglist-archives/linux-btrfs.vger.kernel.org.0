Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: relocation: output warning message for leftover v1 space cache before aborting current data balance
Date:   Tue, 29 Dec 2020 08:38:37 +0800

In delete_v1_space_cache(), if we find a leaf whose owner is tree root,
and we can't grab the free space cache inode, then we return -ENOENT.

However this would make the caller, add_data_references(), to consider
this as a critical error, and abort current data balance.

This happens for fs using free space cache v2, while still has v1 data
left.

For v2 free space cache, we no longer load v1 data, making btrfs_igrab()
no longer work for root tree to grab v1 free space cache inodes.

The proper fix for the problem is to delete v1 space cache completely
during v2 convert.

We can't just ignore the -ENOENT error, as for root tree we don't use
reloc tree to replace its data references, but rely on COW.
This means, we have no way to relocate the leftover v1 data, and block
the relocation.

This patch will just workaround it by outputting a warning message,
showing the user how to manually solve it.
