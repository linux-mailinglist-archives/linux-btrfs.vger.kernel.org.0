Yes, IPE has been in production for years, it used in the feature
described in the couple of minutes of Ignite starting at:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DPO5ijv6WDv0&t=3D608s

But I am not in the team that works on IPE, so I am not the best person
to answer the first question, I do not have a good enough understanding
of the implementation details of IPE/IMA to be able to say. I believe a
new revision will be submitted soon, the submitter is the right person
to ask that question.

The second question is easy: because the kernel is the right place for
our use case to do this verification and enforcement, exactly like dm-
verity does. Userspace is largely untrusted, or much lower trust
anyway.

Yes. We need to use the same mechanism as dm-verity, and in fact many
more systems, already make use of.
