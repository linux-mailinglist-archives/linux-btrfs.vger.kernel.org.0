I've opened an issue https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/issues/495
please continue there. Sending reports by mail also works.

So all the issues are for the manual page references and placement of
the section. The manual pages written RST still lack references to many
other things (issue #476) but the manual page references are a bit
special so there's a separate issue for that. Also for you to follow up
and report anything else you find.

The idea is to use some macros so we don't have to format the references
manually, but I'm lacking the knowledge how to do that in RST.
