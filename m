+Extent-based contents encryption
+--------------------------------
+
+For certain filesystems (currently only btrfs), data is encrypted on a
+per-extent basis, for whatever the filesystem's notion of an extent is. The
+scheme is exactly as with inode-based contents encryption, except that the
+'inode number' for an extent is requested from the filesystem instead of from
+the file's inode, and the 'logical block number' refers to an offset within the
+extent.
+
+Because the encryption material is per-extent instead of per-inode, as long 
+as the extent's encryption context does not change, the filesystem may shift
+around the position of the extent, and may have multiple files referring to
+the same encrypted extent.
+
+Not all extents within a file are decrypted simultaneously, so it is possible
+for a file read to fail partway through the file if it crosses into an extent
+whose key is unavailable.  However, all writes will succeed, unless the key is
+removed mid-write.
