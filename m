Using 5.4.9+ (all of btrfs-5.5) and btrfs-progs 5.4 I just tried and
it still works for me (and always has):

$btrfs scrub start /mnt/backup
scrub started on /mnt/backup, fsid d163af2f-6e03-4972-bfd6-30c68b6ed312 (pid=25633)

$btrfs scrub cancel /mnt/backup
scrub cancelled

$btrfs scrub resume /mnt/backup
scrub resumed on /mnt/backup, fsid d163af2f-6e03-4972-bfd6-30c68b6ed312 (pid=25704)

..and it keeps munching away as expected.

TBH it's a bit odd that there is no "pause" - I'd expect cancel to be final,
but apart from that it seems to work.
