To be clear, I'm not necessarily saying "remove the size field".  But if you
keep it, it needs a proper explanation and careful consideration of what to do
if it doesn't match the actual size.

I don't think 8 bytes per file matters, especially when the Merkle tree blocks
are zero-padded to 4096 bytes anyway.

fsverity_operations::get_verity_descriptor() is supposed to behave like
getxattr().  That means that if the buffer provided is too large, the function
shouldn't fail but rather just read and return the actual size.

That means using true_size above.

I probably should have gone with something harder to get wrong, but getxattr()
semantics seemed "simple".
