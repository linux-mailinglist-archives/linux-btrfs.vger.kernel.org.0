Sorry for disappearing on this one for a while.

Oops, good point. In addressing your and Eryu's points, I realized that
this isn't really a generic test, since as you say, it assumes the
filesystem's implementation. Further, I think it is plausible for an fs
to cache the Merkle tree pages some other way which wouldn't need to
EFBIG for large files. With that said, I do think it's a useful test of
an edge case I got wrong several times in the btrfs implementation.

I am leaning towards making this a btrfs specific test. Just wanted to
double check with you if you think ext4 and f2fs would benefit from
running this test too..

If you use $max_sz or $max_sz-1 (or anything bigger than $max_sz-4096)
the vfs fsverity code will conclude the tree will exceed MAX_LEVELS. I
got LEVELS and DEPTH mixed up.

In my memory, truncate didn't work for btrfs, but it took me a while to
get this to work, so I might have made some silly mistake early on with
truncate. I'll try again to be sure.

Agreed with all of this, will do.
