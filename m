My suggestion was not to use the btrfs metadata to store the "write-intent", but
to track the space used by the write-intent storage area with a bg. Then the
write intent can be handled not with a btrfs btree, but (e.g.) simply
writing a bitmap of the used blocks, or the pairs [starts, length]....

I really like the idea to store the write intent in a btree. I find it very
elegant. However I don't think that it is convenient.

The write intent disk format is not performance related, you don't need to seek
inside it; and it is small: you need to read it (entirerly) only in case of power
failure, and in any case the biggest cost is to scrub the last updated blocks. So
it is not needed a btree.

Moreover, the handling of raid5/6 is a layer below the btree. I think that
updating the write-intent btree would be a performance bottleneck. I am quite sure
that the write intent likely requires less than one metadata page (16K today);
however to store this page you need to update the metadata page tracking...

I don't get the point: I started talking about raid6. The raid6 is two
failures proof (you need three failure to see the problem... in theory).

If P is the probability of a disk failure (with P << 1), the likelihood of
a RAID6 failure is O(P^3). The same is RAID1C3.

Instead RAID10 failure likelihood is only a bit lesser than two disk failure:
RAID10 (4 disks) failure is O(0.66 * P^2) ~ O(P^2).

Because P is << 1 then  P^3 << 0.66 * P^2.
