This is partly my fault, Sweet Tea has been working on this for a while, and it
seems the lack of progress is partly to do with him wanting everything to be
perfect before sending things out, so I've been encouraging him to increase his
iteration frequency so we could get to a mergeable state sooner.

To that end, I told him to leave off the "change the encryption key"
functionality for now and send that along once we had agreement on this part.
My thinking was that's the hairier/more controversial part, and I want to see
progress made on the core fscrypt functionality so we don't get bogged down on
other discussions.

As for the data structures part I was lead to believe this was important for our
usecase.  But it appears you have another method in mind.

In the interest of getting this thing unstuck I'd like to get it clear in my
head what you're wanting to see, and explain what we're wanting to do, and then
I can be more useful in guiding Sweet Tea through this.

What we want (as I currently understand it):

- We have an un-encrypted subvolumed that contains the base image.  Think a
  chroot of centos9 or whatever.
- Start a container, we snapshot this base image, set an encryption key for this
  container, all new writes into this snapshot will now be encrypted with this
  per-container key.
- This container could potentially create a container within this encrypted
  container to run.  Think a short lived job orchestrator.  I run service X that
  is going to run N tasks, each task in it's own container.  Under my encrypted
  container I'm going to be creating new subvolumes and setting a different key
  for those subvolumes.  Then once those jobs are done I'm going to delete that
  subvolume and carry on.

Weird btrfs things that make life difficult:

- Reflink.  Obviously we're not going to be reflinking from an encrypted
  subvolume into a non-encrypted subvolume, everything will have to match, but
  this is still between different inodes, which means we need some per-extent
  context.
- Snapshots.  Technically we would be fine here since the inodes metadata would
  be the same here, so maybe not so difficult.
- Relocation.  This is our "move data around underneath everybody" thing that we
  do all the time.  I'm not actually sure if this poses a problem, I know Sweet
  Tea said it did, but my eyes sort of glaze over whenever we're talking about
  encryption so I don't remember the details.

What I think you want:

- A clearer deliniation in the fscrypt code of what we do with per-extent
  encryption vs everything else.  This is easy for me to grok.
- A lighter weight per-extent encryption scheme.  This is the part that I'm
  having trouble with.  I've been reviewing the code from a "is this broken"
  standpoint, because I don't have the expertise in this area to make a sound
  judgement.  The btrfs parts are easy, and that code is fine.  I trust Sweet
  Tea's judgement to do make decisions that fit our use case, but this seems to
  be the crux of the problem.

This series is the barebones "get fscrypt encrypting stuff on btrfs" approach,
with followups for the next, hairier bits.

But we're over a year into this process and still stuck, so I'm sitting down to
understand this code and the current situation in order to provide better
guidance for Sweet Tea.  Please correct me where I've gone wrong, I've been
going back and reading the emails trying to catch up, so I'm sure I've missed
things.  Thanks,

Josef
