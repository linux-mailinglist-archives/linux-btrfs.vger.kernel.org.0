Yes, I agree completely. I was disappointed the change wasn't made last
time this was discussed on the list. But it wasn't. And I think that was
because of concern over the impact: the change will break some users'
workflows or scripts and could break some important tools, apps or
things like distro installation/upgrade scripts. That was the purpose of
my suggestions: to break down barriers which might delay making this happen.

The point of this suggestion was to address David's concern of not
understanding the use case. This could be useful when discussing the
timing of the fix (and whether it can be backported to stable kernels).

And this suggestion was to make it "possible" to work round the change
but, in practice, harder than just doing the right thing :-) I agree
this is probably too far.
